THE ODES OF HORACE*

to discharge the duties of the office during his brother’s absence
(Dion 54. 19). Of his expedition in the following year against the
Raeti, some account will be found in the Introd. to Book iv. He
died, six years afterwards, from the effect of a fall from his horse,
while engaged in the last of three campaigns beyond the Rhine,
which gained for him the posthumous title of Germanicus.

1. qualem, so v. 13 ‘qualemve’; the apodosis is in v. 17, ‘talem’

first describes the birth and training of the young warrior prince,
the second the astonishment of the enemy when they saw him, and

knew instinctively that they were to be the first victims of his ’

maiden sword.

5. olim seems to answer to‘ iam,’ ‘mo’x, ‘’nunc, which mark

which has good MS. support, and which he judges to have been
the reading of Acron, from his illustration‘ ut rust imbrzferum
vster Probably ‘nimbis remotis’ is enough to account for the
Scholiast' s quotation· , the sound and balance of the sentence are in
favour of ‘verni.’ We need not expect Horace to date the eaglet's
growth with the accuracy of an ornithologist. He is more likely to
use the epithet ‘ vernus ’ in a pleasing sense of the sost breezeS,
than in association merely with storms. ‘Verni' need not mean
the first days of spring, nor is the eaglet said yet to 'be fit for
hunting3 it is of the first stage in the art of fiying. For a conj.
alteration of Horace's text on somewhat similar grounds see
