EPODE V, 89-EPODE vn

3, 4. There is high MS. authority for ‘ verte ' and ‘ pete ’ ; but no
MS. gives the transposition ·’ verte si potes,’ which is necessary to
make the imperative suit the metre. Either construction is lawful,
Virg. E. 2. 71 ‘Quin . . . paras ?’ Aen. 4. 547 ‘Quin morere ut
merita es, ferroque averte dolorem.'

6. amica vis pastoribus, ‘the shepherds’ sturdy friend ’ ; ‘ vis '
is taken (as Virgil's ‘odora canum vis,’ Aen. 4. 132) from Lucretius’
‘permissa canum vis,’ 4. 681, ‘fida canum vis,' 6. 1222, an imitation
of the Greek use of βία. The dogs of Epirus and Sparta are named
in Virg. G. 3. 405. They are used there, as here, both for guarding
the fold and for hunting.

7. agam, sc. ‘ feram quaecumque,' &c., the substantive appearing
with the relative instead of in its more natural place as the ante-
cedent, see on Epod. 2. 37.

8. quaecumque, whatever it be, even itt-it shall be you.

12. Cp. what those who fear his satire say of the satirist, Sat. 1.
4. “ 34 ‘ Foenum habet in cornu.' Mitsch. compares the Greek
ταυροῦμαι, ‘ I become an angry bull,' Aesch. Cho. 272.

13. Epp. 1. 19. 25-30. infido, inasmuch as he had promised his
daughter N eobule to Archilochus and broken his promise.

14. hostis Bupalo. Hipponax, an iambic poet who used his
art to revenge himself on Bupalus and Athenis, two sculptors of
Chios, and brothers, who had caricatured his ugliness. Notice
that each of the epithets ‘ infido‚' ‘ acer,’ is intended, after Horace‘s
manner, to cover to some extent both cases. They strike again the
keynote of the Epode. The masters of iambic verse whom Horace
imitates were like him, unlike his opponent: they struck only at
those who deserved it, and they struck home.

15. atro dente, the ‘ venomous tooth ⁹ of envy or malignity, Od.
4. 3. 16, Mart. 5. 28. 7 ‘robiginosis cuncta dentibus rodit.‘

16. The order is ‘inultus fleb0, ut puer.'

EPODE VII

‘ Is civil war to be renewed‚ and Roman blood to flow again, not
for the destruction of a foreign enemy, but to do the Parthian’s
work and destroy Rome itself ? Even wild beasts do not prey on
their own kind. Does anger blind you, or fate compel you, or is it
mere wauton wickedness? Shame makes them silent, I will answer
for them. It is the bitter heritage of fratricidal bloodshed which
descends to us from the death of Remus.’

There is nothing to fix with precision the date of the Epode. It
expresses horror at the prospect of some fresh outburst of civil war.
The idea of the conclusion is Greek not Roman. The explanation
offered in it of the succession of civil strife is fanciful and literary‚
without the definite political meaning which underlies the mytho-
