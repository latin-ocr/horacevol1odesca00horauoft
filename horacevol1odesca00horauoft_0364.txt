THE ODES OF HORACE

7. ventis. Bentley wished to alter to ‘sentis,’ in order to avoid
the double ablative‘ strepitu‚’ ‘ventis,’ and the rather harsh
zeugma by which ‘audis’ is constructed with ‘ut glaciet nives?
But compare 1. 14. 6 and Virg. Aen. 4. 490‘ mugire videbis Sub
pedibus terram et descendere montibus ornos?

8. puro numme. N umen is divine power in exercise;

‘numine glaciet nives‚’ as Virg. Aen. 4. 269‘ caelum et terras qui

numine torquet.' ‘Purziss of a clear sky, as ‘Iuppiter uvidus,’
‘frigidus‚’ 8ιο. The ancients had observed that cold is greater
with a cloudless sky.

10. ‘Lest rope and wheel run back together.’ Clearly a pro-
verbial expression, though the origin is uncertain. The best
illustration is that quoted from Lucian: σὺ δὲ πάνυ χαλεπὴ ἀεὶ τῷ
ἀνθρώπῳ γεγένησαι, και ὅρα μὴ κατὰ τὴν παροιμίαν ἀπορρήξωμεν πάνυ
τεὶνασαι τὸ καλώδιον. This would seem to give the image of lifting
weights by a pulley. If the rope be drawn too roughly or too far
it will break, the wheel will spin round the wrong way, and the
weight fall back again. Lyce must not overdo her coyneSS, or she
will exhaust the patience of Venus and of her lover.

retro, constr. ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘currente ' and with ‘ eat.’

12. ‘ Your father was a Tuscan3 you are no Penelope to resist
suitors.' For the form cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 42 ‘non me tibi Troia
Externum tulit.’

Tyrrhenus, perhaps only ‘we know all about you3 you must
not set up for more than you are.’ But the Etruscans seem to have
had a bad name for luxurious living.

14. tinctus viola pallor, generally interpreted like Virg. E. 2.
48 ‘ pallentes violas) of the yellow violet. It appears to have been
taken· so by Calpurnius (Ecl. 9. 40) of an unhappy lover, ‘ Pallidior
buxo violaeque simillimus erro! But the words themselves more
naturally suggest Ritter’ s interpretation, ‘sublividus,' of a pale face
scored with dark lines under the eyes.

15. Pieria, from the borders of Macedonia and Thessaly, as
‘Thraessa Chloe!

17. rigida aesculo, seems to be a continuance of the image of
‘ curvat,' ‘ You are as hard to bend as an oak bough.’

19. aquae caelestum Epp. 2. 1. 135.

20. latus, he represents himself as lying on the doorstep, ‘ por-
rectum ante foris.’ Cp. Epod. 11. 32 ‘ Limina dura quibus lumbos
et infregi latus)

ODE XI

‘O MERCURY and my lyre, teach me some strain that will win
the obdurate ear of Lyde. She is like a young unbroken colt ; but
music has made tigers and forest trees and rivers stay to listen.
It has tamed Cerberus, and beguiled the pain of Ixion and Tityus
and the Danaids with their leaking pitchers. Let Lyde hear their
