them- and suffered a defeat, which, though Suetonius makes less of
it (‘ maioris infamiae quam detrimenti‚’ Oct. 23), is ranked by
Tacitus with that of Varus (Ann. 1. 10). At any >rate rit ,was
sufficient to make Augustus set out in person from Rome. Resona,
however, ho reached the frontier, the Sygambri, finding that Lollius
was rallying his forces, and that reinforcements were on their way
from Rome, made a hasty peace, and retired again beyond the
Rhine. See Dion 54. 2ο. Augustus remained in Gaul during
the whole of the two following yearS, and did not return to Rome
till the July of B. C. 13.

‚In the meantime, in the year 15, an important and permanent
conquest had been effected by Tiberius and Drusus, the sons of
Livia by her former husband Ti. Claudius Nero. Merivale recounts
(vol.⁴ iv, ch. 34, p. 142) the operations by which secure possession
was gained by Rome in Augustus' reign of the western passes of
the Alps, the Corniche Road, the passes, that lead from France
to Turin, and the St, Bernard passes into the Val d‘Aosta. ⁴The
work of -Tiberius and Drusus was directed to the similar object
of obtaining military command of the more eastern passes into the Δ
valleys of the Rhine and the Inn, which were still unsafe for the
armies of Rome or her allies, and from which the mountain-tribes
even issued from time to time to plunder Italian soil. Drusus
forced what is now known as the Brenner pass, meeting and ‚over-
throwing the Rhaetians in the valley near Tridentum, now Trent.
In the· meantime, or as soon as Drusus' success was assured,
Tiberius was detached from Augustus' army in Gaul, with the
purpose of taking the enemy in the rear. He ascended the Rhine
valley to the Lake of Constance, where he launched a flotilla of
boats‚ and entering at once several of the valleys which open on
the lake, ‘ penetrated the gorges of the Upper Rhine and Inn in
every direction, so that at the conclusion of a brilliant and rapid
campaign, the two brothers had effected the complete subjugation
of the country of the Grisons and the Tyrol) ‘The -free tribes of
the Eastern Alps -appear then for the first time in hiStory, only to
disappear again· for-a thousand years! - Merivale, vol. ιν, ch. 3 5,
