must have reference.

. ξ 6. The Cantabri, a tribe living in the mountains of the northern
coast of Spain, are named by Dion (51. 20), with their neighbours
the Astures, as in arms against Rome at the time of the general
pacification in Β. c. 29, and as being conquered in that year by

ἕ Statilius Taurus. The next mention of them is in Β. c. 26 (Dion

ἱ 53. 25), in which year the news of their rising reached Augustus‘ m

k Gaul, and diverted him (see above, ξ 3) from his intended expedi-

Τ tion to Britain. He was commanding m person against them in

B.c. 25, but fell ill and was detained at Tarraco for some months.
In the meantime the war was concluded by C. Antistius and

T. Carisius, his ‘legati.’ Augustus himself returned home in
ζ 13.c. 24. In the same year they rose again (Dion 53. 28) and
ff· seized by stratagem and killed some Roman soldiers‚ but were
{f again put down by L. Aemilius.

,- The expressions of Od. 2. 6. 2 ‘Cantabrum indoctum iuga ferre
ἶ nostra: and 2.11. 1 ‘Quid bellicosus Cantaber. .cogitet,’ would

{be intelligible at any time during this period, and as each conquest
³. would be thought final till the next rising, there 1s nothing even in

the words of 3. 8. 21 (‘ Servit Hispanae vetus hostis orae Cantaber
. sera domitus catena’) to fix them necessarily to a single date.
Other considerations perhaps place the Ode, as we shall see, either
{inBUc 29orin 25.

ξ The final subjugation of the Cantabri by Agrippa in 13. c. 19

(Dion 5411) does not come within the period of Odes 1-iii, but is

recorded in Epp. 1. 12. 26, and alluded to in Od.4. 14. 41.

’ἒ ξ 7. Daci, Getae, Scythae, Geloni.—There is much vagueness in
. the use os these names by Horace, as indeed there is confessedly
in their use by prose writers of much later date. The name
s‘Scythae’ is the most comprehensive, being used apparently for
.‡'an the tribes north of the Danube and Euxine. At times it is
brought into close relation with that of the Getae (as in Od. 3.
, 24. 11), who again are closely connected by all writers with the
s· Daci. At other times it is associated with the Geloni and the
Tanais (‘ Scythicus amnis,’ Od. 3. 4. 36), and denotes tribes far
enough to the East to interfere in Parthian politics. The names
