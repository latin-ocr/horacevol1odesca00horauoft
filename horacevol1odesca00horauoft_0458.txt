CARMEN SAECULARE‚ 1-14

as addressed to them, and imagines the Ode to have been sung
processionally, begun and ended on the Palatine‚ these middle ·
stanzas being the part sung on the Capitoline. Itis difficult to see
how the words of the inscription ‘eodemque modo in Capitolio
can describe such a division of the Ode. Their natural interpreta-
tion is of a complete repetition. And indeed it is not true, as
Mommsen supposes, that this passage of the Ode, and no other,
belongs to the Capitoline deities. There is a symmetry which he
does not notice between the earlier part of the Ode which consists
of prayer, and the latter part (v, 53 to the end) m which the chorus ’
assures itself that its prayers are heard and granted. In both cases
the deities put in the foreground are Apollo and Diana, but m both
cases the reference to them generalizes, so that they seem to become '
representatives of the whole company of godS, and the last stanza
in each case indicates or names Jove.

 

1. silvarum potens ; Od. 1. 3. 1 ‘potens Cypri! For this “
attribute of Diana cp. Od. 1. 21. 5, 3. 22. 1, Virg. Aen. 9. 405, &c., ³
Catull. 34. 9 foll.

5. Sibyllini versus. The books which were reported to have
been bought of the Sibyl by Tarquin had been destroyed in the
burning of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, Β. c. 8²3 but a fresh
collection of Sibylline prophecies had been made. Augustus had
caused them to be examined, and many that were deemed spurious
to be burnt. The remainder were deposited by him in two gilt 1
cases at the base of Apollo' s statue in his temple on the Palatine i
(Suet. Oct. 31). They were in the keeping of the ‘ quindecimviri ³
(see on v. 70), who alone were allowed to read them.

6. Both epithets apply to each substantive; see on Od. 3.4. 18, ε

ἔχοντες περιόντας) by Zosimus as also ἐπιφανεῖς, and cp. Od. 4. 6. 31

‘Virginum primae puerique claris Patribus orti!

7. placuere. The perfect is regular ε ‘in whose sight the seven
hills have found favour! It is more definite and final than ‘ placent!

10. The connexion between the description and the prayer seems
to be, ‘unchangeable yourse1f‚ though you cause change and seem
“fflchange' give to the pre-eminence of Rome the same unchange- ὃ
a eness.’

13. rite, probably ‘after thine office’ 3 cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 36, 10. 1
254: for ‘aperire lenis ’ see App. 2, ξ 2.

14. Ilithyia.. The Greek goddess of birth, identified afterwards
with Artemis. As we see in the inscription, and in ZosimuS, sacri·
fice was offered on the second night to Ilithyia or the Ilithyiae, but
here Horace seems to identify Ilithyia with Diana, for Lucina was
one of her titles. Cp. Catull. 34. 13 ‘ Tu Lucina dolentibus Iuno dicta
puerperis! ‘ Genitalis,’ a title in itself intelligible‚ is not elsewhere ἱ
given to her. The relation of stanzas 3 and 4, is pointed by the
epithet with which stanza 3 begins: ‘Alme Sol ’; both deities are
