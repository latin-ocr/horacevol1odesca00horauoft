THE ODES OF HORACEv a.

11. gelida morte carentis, sc.- ‘per deos immortalis.’ As they - ”’

cannot die, it is dangerous to swear falsely by them.
13—16. The very goddess of love, from whom the injured lover
might look for redress3 the Nymphs, for all their own guileless-

ness ; Cupid, usually so terribly in earnest in making lovers feel— ’

all only laugh at Barine's faithlessness.

15. ardentis, πυρφόρους.

16. eruenta, either ‘ that makes them draw blood‚’ or ‘ reddened
with the blood of former victImsss

ODE IX

THE most continuous rains, the longest winters‚ end at last.
Let not your grief for Mystes alone be unending, Valgius. Not
even Nestor grieved inconsolably for the son of his old age, nor
his parents and sisters for the blooming Troilus, ’Tis time to
cease from wailings more womanly than theirs‚ and to sing of
Caesar’s triumphs!

The Ode is addressed to C. Valgius Rufus, a poet whose elegies
are referred to and quoted by Servius on Virg. E. 7. 22, and Aen.
11. 457. The scattered and doubtful hints which can be gleaned
about him will be found in the Dict. Biog. He stands in Sat.
1. 10. 82 with Varius, Maecenas, Virgil, and the other select few

v for whose literary approbation Horace cares. The Scholiasts speak

of him as a ‘Consularis‚’ and the name occurs in the Consular
Faffizssc'ig‘temdf this Ode should be fixed by vv. 18—24‚ but the
references of these lines is a subject of controversy. They have
been used as one of their chief arguments by those who put the
publication of the Three Books as late as B.C. 19, being interpreted
of the events of the year 20, when Augustus was himself in Asia
and Tiberius under his orders advanced into Armenia (see Epp. 1.

Virgil's life. Dr. James Gow (Classical Rev. vol. 9, p. 302 foll.) [j
