THE ODES OF HORACE

gf the stormy waters in v. 27 foll. is therefore not without signi· *⁷
cance.

δ· 26. Hom. 11. 3. 237 Κάστορά θ’ ἱππόδαμον καὶ πυξ ἀγαθὸν Πολυ-
Ευκεα.

pugnis, πυγμαχίᾳ, ‘boxing.’

27. alba stella, see on Od. 1. 3. 2; ‘alba,’ probably as bringing
back clear weather, as ‘albus Notus,' Od. 1. 7. 15.

29. agitatus umor, ‘the wind-driven spray.’ It has been blown
high up the rockS, now it streams down them and is not blown up ’
agam.

31. ponto is a local ablative, where in strictness we require ‘in
pontum‚' as motion is expressed, Virg. G. 1. 401 ‘campo recum-
bunt ’3 cp. Aen. 5. 481 ‘procumbit humi bos.’ ‘

34. superbos Tarquini fasciS. The apparent mention oi ’
Tarquinius Superbus among the Roman worthies has troubled
commentators from the Scholiasts downwards. The latter are v
driven to take the words impossibly of Tarquinius Priscus. A com· j.

His selection of Roman names will then be, the Founders of Rome' s ἑ·
warlike fame and of her law and religion, the first instance and the ν
latest of devotion‘ pulchra pro libertate‚' the representatives of her
military spirit, (1) as to contempt of death, (2) as to loyalty and
simplicity of life. Bentley, in his wish to bind Horace to a chrono- Α
logical order which in such cases he never follows, would rob him
of the credit of the tribute to a lost cause (see on Od. 2. 7) by
reading ex mera conj. ‘ anne Curti.'

37. Regulum, see on Od. 3. 5.

Scauros. The reference is probably, as Kiessling suggested, to '
a story told of M. Aemilius Scaurus and his son (3 and 4 in Dict.
Biog. s. v. ‘Scaurus '). The son had shown cowardice in the war
against the Cimbri, and on returning home was ordered from his
father’s presence, and feeling the disgrace put an end to his own
life. They are named as illustrating the old military spirit.

38. Paulum, L. Aemilius Paulus, the Consul who refused to
leave the fatal field of Cannae, Liv. 22. 38 foll.

40. Fabricium, C. Fabricius Luscinus, Cos. B.c. 282 and 2783
‘parvo potentem Fabricium,' Virg. Aen. 6. 844. The story of his ·
refusal to avail himself of treachery against Pyrrhus is told by ᾗἶ
Cicer0, Off. 3. 22, stories of his contended poverty by Val. Max. 2
4. 3. 6, cp. Cic. T'usc. 3. 23.

41—44. ‘He and Curius of hair unkempt were bred to do good ⁴,
service in war, and Camillus t00, by stern poverty and the ancestral
farm with its cottag e home to match.’ They were ‘rusticorum ἓ
mascula militum proles? Od. 3. 6. 37. ι

41. incomptis, cp. Od. 2. 15.11 ‘intonsi Catonis,' of Cato the ”
Censor. Pliny (N. H. 7. 59) says that the first ‘tonsor' was ’
brought to Rome from Sicily in B.C. 300, and that Scipio Africanus ’
was the first Roman who was shaved daily. To have lived before
