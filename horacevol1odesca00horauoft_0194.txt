THE ODES OF HORACE

’ on a knowledge and imitation of Greek models that Horace rests
his own title to fame. The lute which his muse strings is the ‘ lute ,

Oflidgdggge. The ivy crown belongs to the poet (Virg. E. 7. 25,
8. 13) as inspired by Bacchus3 cp. Juv. 7. 64 ‘dominis Cirrhae
Nisaeque‚' Hor. Epp. 1. 19. 4.

30. dis miscent. superis, not merely like ‘ evehit ad deos' above γ

—‘ glorify me, make me as happy as the gods,'——but ‘ admit me to
a happy dreamland,’ to the Μουσῶν νάπαι, the ‘ pii luci ' of Od. 3. 4.
5 foll.; cp. 3. 25. 1 foll.

32-34. tibias . . . barbiton. The two instruments are intended
to include all varieties of lyric poetry; see on Od. 3. 4. 1—4, and cp.
1. 12. 1, 2. They are divided here between Euterpe and Poly-
hymnia. In one of the two passages referred to they are both
attributed to Calliope, in the other to Clio. For the plural ‘ tibias‚’
cp. Od. 4. 15. 30, Epod. 9. 5, and see Dict. Ant. s. v. The refer-

ence is to the double pipe—two pipes used at the same time—one ⁴

of a higher the other of a lower pitch. Cp. Herod. 1. 17, where the
αὐλοὶ ἇνδρὴἵοι καὶ γυναικήῖοι are generally interpreted in this way. ,

34. Lesboum barbiton. The Greek form of adj. and subst.
seems to point to the imitative character of the poetry which he
aspires to write: see on Od. 1. 32. 3, and on 4. 6. 29. It is to be

 

noticed that Horace prefers in the Odes the Greek form Helenen,

Cypron, &c., in the Satires and Epistles the Latin Helenam, διο.
35. vatibus. The Greek lyric poets—for on Horace’s showing

they had as yet no Roman rival. Cp. Od. 4. 3. 13, and note the change
of tone. He there claims as his own, by gift of the public voice, the ·’

place which here he looks for at the hands of a patron.
36. feriam sidera. ‘ I shall raise my head till it strikes the stars.’

A common Greek trooe. Sapph. Fr. 9 ψαύειν δέ πόλον δοκεῖ μοι 2‘

οὐρανῶ δυσπάχεα. Soph. O. C. 381 πρὸς οὐρανὸν βιβῶν.

ODE II

‘WE have seen and felt enough of the wrath of the gods. Our
population is thinned by civil war, while the Parthians defy us in
safety. What god can save our falling empire‚ or atone for our
guilt? Apollo ? Venus ? our father Mars? nay rather Mercury, who
is amongst us in human shape, and submitting to be called Caesar's
avenger—you must be our prince. Long may you live—stay the
civil war, and chastise the Parthians!'

There is nothing to fix with exactness the date of the composition '¹

of the Ode. The portents spoken of are without doubt those which
followed the death of Caesar, Β. c. 44 (Dion 45. 17, cp. V irg. G. 1.
466 foll., Tib. 2. 5. 71 foll„ Ov. Met. 15. 782 foll.)‚ and therefore,
however early we put the Ode, years must have elapsed since their
occurrence. They are recalled dramatically, not happening at the
