BOOK IV, oDE IV, 1-17

. ⁸ demittit impetus aquilam ’=‘aqui1a cum impetu defertur.’ It has

 

also been taken of his impetuous temper; but it suits Horace’s
economy of words, that the motive in this clause should be gathered
from the ‘ amor dapis atque pugnae’-(a dainty banquet‚ with the
excitement of fighting for it) of the second clause, the mode of
attack in that clause from the ‘vividus impetus’ of this, as the
unresisting weakness of the sheep is left to be inferred from the
epithet given to the serpentS. See on 2. 3. 9, 3. 4. 45, 3. 13. 6,

14. fulvae matris ab ubere. Some awkwardness has been felt
in this expression, as, if we construet it with ‘ depulsum,' either ‘ab
ubere' or ‘lacte’ would seem to be redundant (cp. Virg. E. 7. 17
‘depulsos a lacte,’ G. 3. 187 ‘depulsus ab ubere matris'), and various
modes of treatment have been suggested. ‘ Ubere’ has been taken
as an epithet of ‘ lacte,' but this is to transfer the redundancy from
the expression to the thought: or, again, ‘fulvae matris ab ubere’
has been referred to the hind (Ritter), but it is hard to see how this
adds to the picture ; the youth of the lion is in point, and the pre-
occupation of the hind, but we do not want in any way to under-
value Drusus’ foes. Bentley led the way of conJectural emendation,
‘iarn mane' or ‘iam sponte,’ and has been followed by many
others. The simplest method is to separate ‘ab ubere’ to some
extent from ‘ depulsum,' and to take it in the sense of ‘fresh from
his mother's teats.' Cp. ‘a matre pulli,' Columel., ‘recens a vul-
nere,’ Virg. Aen. 6. 450 ; the place of Virgil’s ‘recens’ is supplied
by the more definite ‘lacte depulsum?

16. peritura vidit, ‘looks up and sees, a moment before she dies
by his unfleshed tooth.’ The repetition ‘ vidit: ‘videre,’ points the
correspondence, and makes it easier to dispense with a more formal
introduction of the apodosis3 see on 2. 9. 9.

17. Raeti . . . Vindelici. It is hard to say which is the adjective.
Geographically Raeti is the larger name of the two, being used to
cover Vindelicia (Raetia secunda), i. e. the northern slopes *of the
Alps from the Lake of Constance to the Inn, as well as Raetia
prima, the southern part of the Grisons and the western Tyrol.
Horace is supported by Dion 54. 22, in giving the common name
of Raeti to the tribes which Tiberius (Od. 4. 14. 14) and Drusus
conquered. But it is certainly a perversiori of the ordinary usage
to assign the Vindelici, both here and in 4. 14, to the invader who
approached from the south. The geographical difficulty is un-
affected by the question of reading raised by Heinsius, Bentley, and
others, as whether we read ‘ Raetis ’ or ‘ Raeti‚’ the two names will
still be given to one locality, and that the scene of Drusus’ victory.
All the MSS. and Aer. are in favour of the nominative. The abla-
tive, distributing the two names between the mountains and the
people, would be more in accordance with Horace’s style, and it
