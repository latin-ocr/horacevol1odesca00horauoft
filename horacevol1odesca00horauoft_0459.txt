CARMEN SAECULARE, 14-26

addressed as in different ways ‘ life-giving ’ powers. Rome’s great-
ness cannot be separated from the well-being and fruitfulness of
Roman mothers. In the following stanza the prayer is applied
specially to Augustus’ legislative efforts to encourage legitimate
marna e.

17. {reducam ‘rear,’ as κουροτρόφος, Hes. Theog. 452.

18—20. The reference is to the ‘ Lex Iulia de maritandis ordini·
bus‚’ which appears to have been enacted in Β. c. 18. Some
uncertainty hangs over its provisions, for we do not know to what
extent it was altered by the supplementary law which was passed in
ΑΛ). 9, in the consulship of M. Papius Mutilus and Q. Poppaeus
SecunduS, and which causes the whole measure to be cited as the
‘ Lex Iulia et Papia Poppaea.' It forbade marriage between
persons of senatorian family and ‘ libertinae‚' imposed penalties on
celibacy (to the extent of the forfeiture of all bequests) and even on
childless marriages in all ranks, and held out exemptions and
rewards to the fathers of legitimate families. Dion briefly mentions
its provisions 54. 16; on the whole matter see MerivaIe, c. 33, vol.
iv, p. 85 foll. For another reference to Augustus’ legislation on this
subject see Od. 4. 5. 21, and cp. Od. 1. 2. 24.

19. prolis feraei; Od. 4. 4. 58 ‘feraci frondis in Algido': cp. 3.
6. 17 and inf. v. 29 ‘fertilis frugum!

20. marita, as an adjective, ‘the marriage law ’ ; so Prop. 4. 11.
33 ‘facibus maritis‚’ Ov. Her. 12. 87 ‘ sacris maritis.’

21. certus . . . orbis, ‘ that so the cycle may be unbroken, and
there may never fail a thronging people to celebrate the secular
games in the hundred and tenth year' (see Introd.). The place of
‘ frequentis' shows that it is emphatic.

22. For the position osque see on Od. 1. 30. 6.

23. ter die claro, i. e. on three successive days.

25. veraces cecinissem see App. 2, ξ 2. The perfect tense,
because he is concerned, not with their prophecies generally, but
with their prophecies of Rome’s destiny; see on 3. 4. 51.

Paroae; the Moerae or Parcae, as we have seen, were the
deities honoured on the first night. In ‘veraces cecinisse ’ there is
perhaps special reference to the Sibylline prophecies.

26—28. The relative clause seems rightly taken by Ritter and
Dillr. with ‘ bona iungite fata,' in a similar construction to ‘ quod
felix faustumque sit‚’ δια, ‘As once and for aye has been promised
—and Time's landmark, that may not be removed, protect the
promise l—link happy destinies to those already accomplished.’ In

dictum est,’ Horace is remembering the etymology of ‘ fatum.’ In
⁶ rerum Terminus' he is possibly thinking of the landmark of
Roman empire that might never recede, and its pledge in the
statue of Terminus, who would not give way even to Jupiter on the
Capitol (Ov. Fast. 2. 667 foll.) ; but the metaphorical use occurs in
Virg. Aen. 4. 614 ‘ Et sic fata Iovis poscunt, hic terminus haeret,'
where we have reminiscences of Accius, (481 Ribbeck) ‘ veter
fatorum terminus‚' and Lucr. 1. 78 ‘ alte terminus haerens.'
