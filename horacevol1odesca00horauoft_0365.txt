BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE X, 7--ODE XI, 12

tale —how they slew their husbands, all save one—their punishment,
and Hypermnestra’ 5 undying glory?

Lyde is warned not ‘placito pugnare amori 'by the story of the
Danaids and their punishment, and the noble exception of Hyper-
mnestra. The application of the story is not very close. The form
of the Ode seems to be a nearer imitation than usual of the
construction of an Ode of Pindar; the commencement by an
invocation of Mercury and the lyre3 the accidental way in which,
through the recountal of the feats of music, the Danaids are
introduced; the myth told at length, but left to be applied by the
reader's wit. Compare 3. 3 and 3. 27.

For the story of the Danaids read Aesch. Pr. V. 853— 869, and
Ov. Her. 14 ‘I-Iypermnestra Lynceo,’ which contains frequent
reminiscences and expressions of passages in this Ode. Compare
vv. 3, 4 ‘Clausa domo teneor gravibusque coercita vinclis: Est
mihi supplicii causa fuisse piam, ’.&c with vv. 45, 46 of the Ode,
vv. 35, 36 with 41 foll, vv. 73, 74 ‘Surge age, Belide, de tot modo
fratribus unus; Nox tibi, ni properas, ista perennis erit‚’ with
vv. 37, 38, and vv. 127-130 with v. 51, see note.

Ritter suggests that the story would be especially familiar to the
Roman public at the time when Horace was writing these Odes‚
from the fact that a group of the Danaids formed a chief feature in
the portico of the temple of Apollo on the Palatine, which Augustus
dedicated in B.c. 28 (see Od. 1. 31). Prop. 3. 23. 4, Ov. A. A. 1.
73, id. Am. 2. 2. 3.

1. Mercuri. Mercury is coupled with the ‘testudo,’ χέλυς (Hom.

. Hymn. Merc. 47 foll.), of which he was the mythical inventor. The

 

whole tortoise- shell was used as a sounding bottom, the horns
(πήχεις) rising from its end and supporting the ζύγον, from which
the strings were stretched to it. See Dict. Ant.

3. septem nervis; Hom. l. c. 51 Eri-r& δὲ συμφώνους’ οΐων ἐτανύσ-
