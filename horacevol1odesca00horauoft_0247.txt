ὲ lyric verse for my dear friend Lamia)

It is difficult to see the point of connexion between the first and
last parts of the Ode, unless indeed, as has been suggested, Horace

³? is holding up his own chweerfulness and its source to Lamia's
. imitation, see Introd. to Od. 3. 17. If Epp. 1. 14. 6 refer to the
, same person as the two Odes, the trait there given, ‘ rapto de fratre

dolentis Insolabiliter‚' may confirm the idea that he was a person

on whom sorrow sat heavily.
Aelius Lamia, the school friend of Numida (Od. 1. 36. 7) and the

„ ‘vetusto nobilis ab Lamo' of 3. 17. 1, is generally identified with
γ L. Aelius Lamia who was Praefectus urbi in A.D. 32, and died
. A.D. 33: Tac. Ann. 6. 27 ‘genus illi decorum, vivida senectus.’
If this Ode therefore is to be dated before Β. C. 23, he must have
,ζ been quite a young man when it was written. Ritter, feeling this
to be a difficulty, suggests that the Lamia of the Odes is an elder
brother of Lucius. The name of a Q. Aelius Lamia, ‘triumvir
ξ monetalis, ’ has been found on a coin of this date. He thinks that
it is his death that Lucius is represented as lamenting in Epp.

With vv. 1— -6 cp. Virg. G. 2. 490-497. The friendship of the
Muses gives to Horace the freedom which Virgil attributes to

philosophy and a country life.

uninteresting, in comparison with poetry‚ are the political questions
in which every one but he is absorbed. This he expresses in two
ways in the two clauses; in the first, by not namz'ngthis formidable
king, only the character of his country, at the world’ 5 end‚‘ a frozen
coast at the north pole', · in the second, by naming the Parthian
