BOOK I, ODE XVII, 1-19

following the analogy of ‘equuleus,’ ‘equula,’ ‘hinnuleus’). We
haVe to weigh the probability of such an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον against the

Δ ’ probability of the name of some wood or hill near the farm being

otherwise unknown to us.
10. utcumque, temporal, as always in Hor. Od. 1. 35. 23, 2. 17.

¹ 11, 3. 4. 29, 4. 4. 35, Epod. 17. 523 here, as in Od. 4. 4. 35, it means

scggpgpaasihe pipe of Faunus. ‘Pan primus calamos cera con-
iungere plures Instituit,’ Virg. E. 2. 32.

11. cubantis, the meaning of the epithet cannot be certainly

’ ’ζ known till we are sure what ‘ Ustica’ was, which it qualifies. Is it

 

‘low-lying,’ of a valley, or some spot in a valley; Theoc. 13. 40
ἡμένῳ ἐν χώρῳὲ or ‘ sloping‚’ of a hill-side, Virgil's ‘colles supini,’
G. 2. 2763 Lucretius’ ‘cubantia tecta‚’ 4. 528?

13. di me tuentur. He sums up the previous stanzas. The
thought was apparently at first only the beauty of Lucretilis which
draws Faunus even from Arcadia3 but it has passed into the wider
idela that the Farm and its owner are under the special protection
o eaven.

14. hie. The great majority of MSS. have ‘hinc,' and we must
add Acr. and Porph.‚ who interpret ‘ scilicet de Sabino fundo.’ But
‘hic ' and ‘hinc’ (hc) are often confused, as in Od. 1. 21. 13, where
B has ‘ hinc ’ against the clear sense. And the balance of the three
promiseS, country pleasures, music, and good wine without quarrel-
ling, perhaps justifies the almost unanimous preference given by
the editors to ‘ hic? Α

14-16. The construction is ‘copia, ruris honorum opulenta, be-
nigno cornu manabit tibi ad plenum? ‘Plenty, rich in all the
pride of the country, shall stream from her bounteous horn into thy

‘j lap till it is full)

15. ad plenum, adverbially, as in Virg. G. 2. 244 ‘ Huc ager ille
malus dulcesque a fontibus undae Ad plenum calcentur.’

16. honorum = ‘ omnium quibus honestatur rus,’ Orelli ; i.e.
flowers, fruits, &c. S. 2. 5. 12 ‘dulcia poma Et quoscumque feret
cultus tibi fundus honores! So leaves are ‘silvae honor,’ Epod. 11.

cornu, the horn of plenty. Ovid gives two forms of legend.

. In Fast. 5. 115 it is the broken horn of a goat which Amalthaea

filled with fruit for the infant Jupiter. In Met. 9. 85 foll. it is the

— horn which Hercules broke from the forehead of Achelous, and

which the N aiads filled for Plenty, ‘ pomis et odoro flore.'
17. reducta valle, as in Epod. 2. 13 and Virg. Aen. 6. 703
‘deep-drawn,’ running into the hills. It suggests the ideas both of

.ss quiet and of shade.

18. fide Teia, in songs such as Anacreon might have written
and sung.

19. dices, see on 1. 12. 13.

laborantis in uno, wearying themselves for love of the same
man, viz. UlysseS.
