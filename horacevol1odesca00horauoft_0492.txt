THE EPODES OF HORACE

expressing its hopelessness. He cannot see its issue, any more
than in Epod. 7 he can see its causes.

The Pseudo· Acron quotes from a lost work of Sallust, to the
effect that Sertorius, after his defeat, thought of sailing into the
Atlantic in search of the fabled islands of the blest‚ ‘ad insulas

Fortunatas voluisse ire.’ The genuineness of the quotation is ἕ

confirmed by Servius, who, on Virg. Aen. 5. 735, refers to Sallust as
having spoken of the μακάρων νῆσοι. Plutarch tells the same story
in the life of Sertorius, ch. 9. It is very possible that Horace may
have heard it, and that it may have suggested the conclusion of
the E pode.

Compare the description of the Happy Islands both in thought
and expression with Virgil’s Golden Age in Ecl. 4.

Metre—-Pythz'ambz'cum 11¹³.

1. altera aetam the first would be the generation of Sulla and
Marius,

teritur, ⁴ is being wasted‚’ Virg. Aen. 4. 271.

2. Epod.7.10.

3-8. For the absence of chronological order‘ m the list of national
dangers cp. Od. Ι. 12. 33- 44, 2. 12. 1-4. The arrangement, such as
it is, is geographical. ‘No enemy however near home or far away.²

3. Marsi. The reference is to the Marsic or Social war, Β. C.
91- -88, cp. Od. 3. 1418.

5. Capuae. With special reference, no doubt, to the revolt of
Capua in the Second Punic War; but the popular jealousy of Capua
as a possible rival of Rome lasted so late that Cicero plays upon it
in his two speeches, de Leg. Agr. contr. Rullum.

Spartacus, cp. Od. 3. 14. 193 the Thracian freebooter who,
having been taken and sold as a gladiator, escaped, and was for
two years (B.C. 73—71) the terror of Rome as the leader of the
Servile war.

6. novis rebus, prob. the abl. ‘ in the hour of revolution ’ rather
than the dat. with ‘infidelis.’ The reference is apparently to the
way in which they played fast and loose at the time of the Catili-
narian conspiracy, coquetting with the conspirators, betraying them
to Cicero, and then within a few months invading Gallia Narbo-
nensis. Cicero (Prov. ConS. 13. 32) speaks of their defeat on this
occasion by C. Pomptinus as the escape from a serious danger,
‘republica metu liberata. ’ The territory of the Allobroges lay
between the Rhone and the Isere.

7. caerulea, ‘blue— eyed‚’ Juv. 13. 164‘ Caerula quis stupuit Ger-
mani lumina, fl’avam Caesariem.’ The reference is to the incursions
of the Cimbri and Teutones, which were finally checked by Marius
and Catulus in {he battles of Aquae Sextiae (B. c. 102) and Raudii
Campi (B.C. 101 .

8. parentibus abominatus. Orelli and Dillr. take ‘ parentibus '
as ‘ our forefathers‚' but the parallel, Od. 1. 1. 24 ⁴ bella matribus
