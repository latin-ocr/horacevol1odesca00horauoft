THE EPODES OF HORACE

hue et hue.1n prose it would be rather‘ huc et illuc' ; cp.
Epod. 2. 31 ‘hinc et hinc!

10. liberrima3 Epod. 11. 16 ‘libera bilis, ’ ‘ finding free vent.’ ⁶.
The remaining verses represent the actual expression of the indigna· 5
tion. This is clear, as Ritter points out, from the change from the ,

second person to the third.

11. triumviralibus; Dict. Ant. s.v.‘Triumviri capitales.’ They

had the power of inflicting summary punishment upon slaves.

12. praeconis ad fastidium, ‘till the crier was tired.’ What
part the crier played in the chastisement does not appear. The
editors say that he had to go on proclaiming the culprit’s offence,
but they allege no adequate authority. Porph.’s note is ‘donec . . .
praeco cum vellet desinere iuberet.'

13. Falerni, some of the best land in Campania. The Scholiasts
remark that in Italy the vines are trained on trees, and the ground
between them ploughed and sown. The Appian way is perhaps
named as the road which he would naturally traverse on his way
between Rome and his eState.

15. ‘ Sits grandly as a knight in the front seats, and snaps his

fingers at Otho? He has no sear of a prosecution under Otho’ s s

law for taking a seat in the fourteen rows reserved for the‘ equites’
and persons ‘equestri censu, ’for he is possessed of far more than

the requisite 400,ooo sesterces; cp. Epp. 1. 1. 58, 62. For other ⁴

references to this law of L. Roscius Otho see Cic. Mur. 19. 40,
Juv. 3. 159, 14. 324. It would seem from the allusion here, as well
as from other considerations, that the purpose of the law ‘was
exclusive and aristocratic.

17. quid attinet, ‘what good is it?’ No exact parallel can be
quoted for ‘ ora navium rostrata ’ = ‘ships with their beaked bows ’;
but we need hardly alter it with Bentley for that reason to ‘ aera.’
Perhaps we may compare Homer’s νῆες μιλτοπάρῃοι, and Aeschylus’
converse use of πρώρα and καλλίπρωρος, of the human face.

18. duei seems to imply that an expedition was at that time
fitting out against Sextus Pompeius and his ‘gang of brigands and
slaves’; cp. Epod. 9. 9, 10.
