thinks, ‘from my house,’ so as to correspond with ‘patet ianua
Lydiae! It is hard to be sure of the exact metaphor felt in
‘excutitur,’ or even whether it and ‘ patet ianua' are either or both
of thern metaphorical.

20. Lydiae, the dative, not the genitive, as it has been taken.

21. sidere pulchrior3 3. 19. 26 ‘Puro te similem, Telephe,
vesper0.’ Astyanax in Hom. Il. 6. 401 is ἐναλίγκιος ἀστέρι καλῷ.

23. iracundior. His levity and his passionate temper have
both been shown in the quarrel which is being made up.

Hadria3 1. 33. 15.

ODE X

WHAT the Greeks called a παρακλαυσίθυρον. Other specimens
may be seen and compared in Theoc. 3. 23 foll„ Propert. 1. 16.
17 foll. Cp. also Horace, Od. 1. 25. 6—8, 3. 7. 29 foll.

The poet personates a lover singing under his mistress' window
on a frosty night, and appealing to her pity to let him in. ‘ Venus
will resent and punish your pride; you have no right from your
origin to give yourself the airs of a Penelope. Though no human
feelings—gratitude, pity, jealousy—will make you love me, yet
as a goddess be merciful. O, hard and cruel heart! there are
limits to your lover’s patience.'

Compare with the Ode 4. 13, which seems to be the revenge
which is here threatened.

Metre——Fourtb A sclepthd.

1. Tanain ei biberes, 2. 20. 20 ‘ Rhodani potor ’; 4. 15. 13 ‘qui
Danuvium bibunt.’ The form of expression is as old as Hom. Il. 2.
825 πίνοντες ὕδωρ μέλαν Αἰσήποιο. ‘If you were a Scythian, with
a husband as stern as husbands are there.' Cp. 3. 24. 20-25
‘peccare nefas aut pretium est mori? Lyce's husband is of a
different kind, v. 15. .

2. asperas, morally, ‘ shut in my face?

3. ineolis, ‘native‚' sc. to Scythia. Horace suggests, though
lsie dges not say, that the north wind to-night is as cold as that of

cyt ia.

5. nemun. This is usually taken of the few trees which in
a large house were planted within the ‘peristylium'3 see on Epp.
1. 10. 23 ‘inter varias nutritur silva columnas? Ritter contends
that Lyce is not imagined as in the rank of life to which such an
appendage of a palace would be appropriate, and takes it of some
public plantation, perhaps the ‘duo luci’ (Liv. 1. 8), between the
two tops of the Capitoline.

6. inter pulchra tecta, ‘Though we are not in the Scythian
wilds, and though you are comfortably lodged, yet the wind howls
outside as loudly and the frost bites as keenly.’
