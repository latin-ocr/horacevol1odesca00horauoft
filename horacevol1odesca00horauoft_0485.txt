ADDITIONAL NOTE

oN VERSES 25, 26.

The Comm. Cruq. seems to have read ‘ Africano‚’ for it stands so
not only in the lemma, but also in the construction of the sentence
in his note ‘neque Africano triumpho reportasti parem Augusto
ducem.’ With this reading the lines have been taken in two ways:

1. Ritter and Nauck make ‘Africano [bello] ⁹ the antecedent to
‘ cui,’ ‘in [that] war in Africa for which Valour made a burial-place
in the ruins of Carthage! This has the advantage of avoiding the
gravest objection which Bentley takes to the reading: ‘ Africano ’ is
not made by itself the antithesis to ‘ Iugurthino,’ for the clause ‘ cui,’
&c., indicates what ‘ war in Africa’ is meant. ‘ Africano ’ however
remains in this case, it must be confessed, in a place where we
look for a word of emphasis, somewhat tame and needless. The
phrase ‘ sepulcrum condere bello' may have had literary antecedents
which if we knew them would explain it. In itself it does not read
quite like Horace, and Cicero’s ‘bellurn sublatum et sepultum'
(Leg. Man. 11. 30), which is quoted, falls much short of it.

2. Pliiss, in the chapter of his H oraz Studien already referred to,
gives a new turn to the whole passage by making the antecedent
to ‘ cui ' not ‘ bello ' but ‘ ducem? The lines, he says, are ironical.
‘ Ducem’ is used not of the conquering general, but of the con-
quered‚ who is brought home to grace the triumph. Cleopatra is
the person meant, and compared to Jugurtha and to Hasdrubal.
The words‘ cui super Carthaginem, δια, are explained of Has-
drubal’ S brave words (Polyb. ΙίδΕΙΙ. 39. 2), καλὸν ἐντάφιον εἶναι τοῖς εὖ
φρονοῦσι τὴν πατρίδα καὶ τὸ ταί-ιτγς πῦρ, in spite of which he after-
wards surrendered to Scipio. The fatal objection to this theory,
ingenious and tempting as it is, is the necessity which it involves of
taking‘ Africano' by itself as = ‘Punico‚' as though the Jugurthine
war was not also‘ Africanum.'

Kiessling adopts Madvig' s neat emendation ‘Africani,’ i.e. ‘neque
bello cui Africani virtus sepulcrum condidit.’ This would avoid
many, but not all, of the difficulties noticed.
