THE oDEs oF HORACE

5. Maeonius3 1. 6. 2, the adjectival form of ‘ Maeonides. ' Tra-
dition was divided on the question whether Homer was so called
as literally a son of Maeon, or only as a Lydian.

6. latent, are hidden from sight, forgotten.

7. Ceae· , 2. 1. 38, the Muse of Simonides.

Alcaei minaces, the poems in which he attacked Myrsilus and -

other tyrants of Mitylene: cp. ‘pugnas et exactos tyrannos,’ 2.
13. 31.

8. Stesichori graves Camenae. To us who do not possess his
poemS, the epithet is best interpreted by Quintil. 10. 1. 62 ‘ Stesi-
chorum quam sit ingenio validus materiae quoque ostenderunt,
maxima bella et clarissimos canentem duces et epici carminis onera
lyra sustinentem. Reddit enim personis in agendo simul loquen-
doque debitam dignitatem?

9. lusit, as παίζειν, of light and playful poetry. It contrasts with
the dignity of Stesichorus and the passion of Sappho, see on 1. 32. 2.

11. commissi, confided as secrets. Sat. 2. 1. 30 ‘Ille velut fidis
3103113 sodalibus olim Credebat libris? ‘ She told her secret to the
lute, And yet its chords with passion thrill,’ Conington.

12. Aeoliae; 2. 13. 24.

13 foll. Horace passes from the defence of lyric poetry as con-
trasted with epic, to the power of verse generally. He employs
a variety of forms to express the central thought, viz. that the
persons and deeds which are Homer's theme, had their counter-
parts in the age before him, as worthy of record as they, yet
which all perished as though they had never been: ‘non sola,'
‘primusve,' ‘non semel‚’ ‘non solus,’ ‘non primus.’ Then the
same thought is stated affirmatively in v. 25.

13-16. The construction is ‘non sola arsit crinis, mirata et
aurum cultusque et comites‚' ‘que’ coupling the things more closely
connected, ‘et . . . et’ those which are more distinct, ‘his dress
and his suite.'

14. crin-im 1. 15.14.

16. Lacaena. The epithet recalls the whole story of the Trojan
war. It would not have been in place a stanza later ; but here the
complete identification, as though he had said ‘ Homer's Helen, ’
helps the transition.

1 17. 'I'euoer3 1. 15. 24, Hom. 11. 13. 313 ὃς ἄριστος Ἀχαιῶν
τοξοσυνῃ.

cydonio, Cretan, a perpetual epithet, 1. 15. 17 ‘calami spicula
Gnosii‚' Virg. E. 10. 59 ‘torquere Cydonia cornu Spicula.' Cydon
or Cydonia was an important city of Crete; Herod. 3. 44, Thuc.
2· 35

18. non semel Ilios, ‘the siege of Troy was not 11119100οᾶ01110ᾱῇ

‘A Troy,' a city as great as Troy, has often stood as long a siege.

21. Ηο passes from the gallantry of attack to that of defence3
from Grecian heroes to Trojan.

26. illacrimabiles, ‘ where none can weep for thern.’ The
adjective is used actively in 2. 14. 6.
