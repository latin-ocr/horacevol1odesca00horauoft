THE ODES OF HORACE

ODE XVI

‘GOLD is all powerful, and powerful for harm. M ythology and
history prove it. And with the glowth of wealth care grows and
the thirst sor greater wealth.1 take example by you, Maecenas,
and shun eminence. The more we deny ourselves, the more the
gods give us. I am prouder and happier in my poor little farm, its
clear stream, its wood, and unfailing crops, than the man who owns
all Africa. Ι have no superfluous luxuries, but I never feel the

pains of penury. Reduced desires give a larger revenue than the .

widest lalifimdz’a. Who seek much want much. Happy the man
who has, though little, yet enough!

per medios satellites, i..e in order to reach and strike at a
tyrant.

10. perrumpere saxa, ‘munitiones expugnare? Acr.

11. auguris. Amphiaraus the seer went to the Theban war,
though he foresaw its issue, at the persuasion of his wife Eriphyle,
who had been bribed by Polynices with a necklace; ὄλετ’ ἐν Θήβῃσι
γυνα ’ων εἵνεκα δώρων, Hom. Od. 15. 247· , cp. ib. 11. 325, Soph. El.
