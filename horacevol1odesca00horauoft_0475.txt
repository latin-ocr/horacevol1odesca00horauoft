as is above water of a swimmer’s body, when it floats as though it
hung by the chin. ’

37. exsecta. This (or‘ execta ⁹) is the reading of most of the
MSS. Bentley’s objection that we require rather an epithet to
correspond with ‘aridum,’ is very well answered by Ritter. We do
not require one, for‘ aridum’ is intended to cover both substan-
tives, as is ‘exsecta’ also; see on Od.2.1o.6,2.11.1,2.15.18‚
20, 3 4 18, 4 9· 29

39. interminato, pass. part. of the usually deponent‘ interminor,’
a stronger word than ‘ interdico,’ ‘ forbidden with threats.'

semel with ‘ cum,’ ‘as soon as ever,’ as ‘ut semel,’ Sat. 2. 1. 24.

41. non defuisse, ‘ was not wanting to her part ’ ; see argument.
The mention of Folia of Ariminum (a town of Umbria on the
Adriatic), apparently a real person, and the appeal to the gossip of
Naples, are intended to give an air of truthfulness to the story.

43. otiosa, a town of Greeks and seaside loungers, who εἷς οὐδὲν
ἕτερον εὐκαίρουν ἢ λέγειν τι καὶ ἀκούειν καινότερονζ cp. LiV. 8. 22
‘gentem lingua magis strenuam quam factis? The Comm. Cruq
says that N aples was called‘ fabulosa,’‘ gossiping.’

4.5 sidera. exeantata3 Epod.17 5and 78, Virg. E. 8. 69.

47. iri-enectum, ‘grown long’ ; Sat. 1. 8. 26 ‘scalpere terram
Unguibus! It is another attribute of the Furies3 see on v. 15, and
ΕΡ· V· 93·

dente livido, blaek from age, to add to the repulsiveness of the
picture; or 11ke ‘dente invido,' Od. 4. 3. 16, the passion ofjealousy
being attributed to the tooth. The action is intended to express
her excitement as she awaits impatiently the issue of her spells.

49. quid dixit, aut. quid tacuit, a proverbial way of expressing
want of restraint in speaking, whether, as here, from passion, or as
in Epp. 1. 7. 72 ‘ dicenda tacenda locutus,’ from garrulity3 cp. ῥητὰ
ἄρ ητά τε.

go, Cp. Medea’s invocation Ov. Met. 7. 192 foll. ‘Nox‚ ait,
arcanis fidissima . . . Tuque triceps Hecate quae coeptis conscia
nostris Adiutrixque venis‚' Theocr. 2. 10. 12.

arbitrae, in Cicero's sense of ‘ witnesses,’ Off. 3. 31.

53. in hostilis domos, perhaps only the common formula for
‘avert from my home’; cp. Od. 1. 21. 14 ‘in Persas atque Bri-
tannos‚’ 3. 27. 21. If special ‘ enemies’ must be found, they will be
her rivals in the love of Varus.

55. formidulosis. The force of the epithet seems to lie, as the
Scholiast implies, ln its suggestion of the ‘awfulness' of night, ‘now
that your spell is on the woods and their inhabitants! The two
verses combine the ideas of the hour of midnight as the time when
magic powers are strongest, and of the lover awake while all the
rest of the world is asleep‚ as Dido in Virg. Aen. 4. 525 ⁴ Cum
tacet omnis ager, pecudes pictaeque volucres,¹ &c.

57-60. The prayer os the next four lines' 1s not quite clear Why
