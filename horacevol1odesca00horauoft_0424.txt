THE ODES OF HORACE

‘Sicilian’ waters and the metaph. of‘ equitavit' are due to Eur.
Phoen. 209 περιρρῦτων Ι ὑπὲρ ἀκαρπίστων πεδίων Ι Σικελίας Ζεφύρου
πνοαῖς l‘ ιππεῦσαντος, κτλ. In its simple sense, and as a matter of
construction, the verb belongs to Hanniba13 metaphorically and
with a zeugma, it supplies also the verb of‘ flamma’ and‘ Eurus.’

45. secundis laboribus erevit, ‘ grew ever more and more
lsucgessful in its enterprises '; the ablative as in. 3. 30. 8 ‘crescam
au e.'

46. impio, because they affronted Roman gods.

47. Poenorum tumultu. A ‘ tumultus’ was a sudden and
dangerous war on or within the bprders‚ usually a Gallie or Italian
one. Cicero explains its nature in Phil.8. 1. 3. Cp. especially,
‘Itaque maiores nostri tumultum Italicum, quod erat domesticus,
tumultum Gallicum, quod erat ltaliae finitimus, praeterea nullum
nominabant? The expression, then, in the text is almost an
oxymoron, ‘a war with CarthaginianS‚ but yet a war in our own
borders.’

48. deos rectos, of the images thrown down by Hannibal, and
now set on their pedestals again.

49. The speech of Hannibal is founded on the saying actually
attributed to him by Livy on learning of Hasdrubal’s defeat and
death: ‘tanto simul publico familiarique ictus luctu, agnoscere se
fortunam Carthaginis fertur dixisse? Liv. 27. 51.

perfidus.1t was the stock charge against him. Livy speaks of
his‘ perfidia plus quam Punica,⁹ 21. 4.

51. ultro, aggressively, needlessly

opimus triumphus, ‘a rare triumph? a phrase coined by
Horace to the model of‘ spolia opima?

53. gens. ‘These armies that we have been provoking are to us
as wolves to deer. Remember the story and character of the
Roman people generally? The stanza is a re‘sume‘ of the story of
the Aeneid. Cp. especially Aen. 1. 1—7‚ 67, 68.

cremato fortis ab Ilio. Grammatically ‘ab Ilio’ answers to
‘ ad urbes Ausonias,' and ‘fortis ’ qualifies ‘pertulit ’3 but the collo-
cation which pairs ‘fortis’ with ‘cremato‚’ and makes ‘ab Ilio’
follow closely and apparently depend on ‘ fortis' (‘ stepping forth in
strength from the ashes of Ilium '), is meant to suggest the idea of
the next stanza, that their very calamities only gave them fresh
heart and vigour. They rise like the Phoenix from its pyre.
Vv. 53, 54 contrast the perils of fire and of water.

54. iactata, probably agreeing with‘ gens‚’ ‘for all their tpssing
on the Tuscan sea? ‘Multum ille et terris iactatus et alto‚’ Virg.
Aen. 1. 3.

saora3 Virg. Aen. 1. 68, 2. 293.

56. pertulit, of perseverance through difficulty, and of success.

57. dur-1⁸3 see on3. 11. 31, Epod. 5. 30·

58. mgrae; 1. 21. 9. See there also for Mt. Algidus. its holm-
oaks are celebrated m 3. 23. 10.

feraci frondis, as ‘fecunda culpae saecula‚’ 3. 6. 173 cp. C. S. 19.
