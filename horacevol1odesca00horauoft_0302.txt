THE ODES OF HORACE

read ‘ incomptum,’ put a comma at ‘maturet,’ constructing ‘in-
comptum nodum ' as a cognate accusative with ‘ religata.’

ODE XII

‘ No, Maecenas, my lyric style will not do for the great feats of
Roman arms, any more than it would for the heroic mythS. You

will celebrate Caesar’s glories far better in your prose history. Ι ,

will content myself with singing the charms of your Licymnia and
your love for her.’

With the Ode generally compare 1. 6.

The Scholiasts (on Sat. 1. 2. 64) give the tradition that Licymnia
is a name invented by Horace to veil and yet to represent to the
initiated that of Terentia, Maecenas’ wife. (See Introd. to Ode 2.

Io.) Many stories are told of her beauty and of her influence over ⁴
Maecenas, as well as of the trouble she gave him. Horace reminds ,

him of the day, perhaps, when he first saw her, dancing in Diana’s

Servius (on Virg. G. 2. 42) vouches for his having done so; but⁴

the only older authority that can be quoted is a doubtful expression ’ἒ

of Pliny, N. H. 7. 46.

Roman wars generally.

2. durum. Bentley compares Virg. G. 3. 4 ‘Eurysthea durum,'
and points out that there is a Horatian antithesis between it and
the‘ molles citharae modi? The earlier editors alter it on very
slight MS. authority to ‘ dirum,’ the epithet of Hannibal in od. 3.
