INTRODUCTION TO THE

Horace, and 100 years, as by Val. AntiaS, Livy, and Varro, whom ’
Censorinus quotes.

The historical performances are at varying periods, but all with q.
some reference to an intended secular date. Merivale writes, ‘ The ἶέ
emperor Claudius repeated the games in the year A.U.c. 800, dis·
regarding those of Augustus as irregular. Claudius was disregarded
in his turn by Domitian, who renewed the celebration in 841,
anticipating in his impatience, by six years, the period prescribed
by Augustus. To the Augustan computation Severus conformed
precisely, and repeated the solemnity in 957, after two intervals of
110 years each. Philippus, however, returned once more to the =
precedent of Claudius in the year of the City 1000. This was the
last celebration.9

The occasion of Augustus' revival 0r institution of these games
was the close of what may be considered the first decade of the
empire, the renewal to him (though professedly only for five y‘ears
more), at his own request, of the ‘imperium,’ which in B.C. 27 he
had, apparently with difficulty, been persuaded to accept for ten
years. ’

The ‘ quindecimviri ’ (see on v. 70, and cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 73), the
custodiaris of the Sibylline Books, found in them the requisite
instructions. Ateius Capit0, a great jurist and antiquarian, was ἶ
appointed to settle the ceremonies. What these were we should Ὺ
have known with exactness if we had possessed the account which
Tacitus gave (see Ann. 11. 11), in a book of the Histories now lost,
of the celebration in Domitian's reign, on which occasion he was
himself one of the quindecimviri and a praetor. As it is, the earliest
extant account in literature is that which is printed below from the
historian Zosimus (in the middle of the fifth century). He claims‚
as it will be seen, for it the authority of inscriptions (ἀναγέγραπται),
and a fortunate discovery has recently enabled us to verisy and in
one or two points to supplement or correct his description.

In September, 1890, there were found built into a mediaeval wall
near the river bank in the old Campus Martius, by the present
Church os S. Giovanni de’ Fiorentini, the fragments of two columns ·
which were erected in accordance witha senatus consultum (‘eo
loco ubi ludi futuri sint ’) to record severally the celebrations of the
Secular Games under Augustus and under Septimius Severus.
