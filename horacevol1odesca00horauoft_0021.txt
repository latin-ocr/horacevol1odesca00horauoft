GENERAL IN TRODUCTION

the cleverest and most plausible guessing, and because it cannot be

proved that in such a text as that of Horace guessing on a large
.- scale is necessary. One more remark may be allowed. An editor
⁷ with the feelings which I have described will yet feel bound to

recall, and to sorne extent to discuss, the more famous conjectures
ι which have become part of the literary history of his author, and in
doing so he will run the risk‚ at timeS, of seeming to treat great
names ungraciously. It must be remembered therefore that to
have learnt to distrust a method is not to deny the genius os those
who used it, and who, by showing us its results at its best, have
taught us the limits of its capability. The solid value of Bentley's
edition is diminished very little by the fact that very many of his
3 conclusions are such as we cannot now accept with any confidence
³ or even accept at all. There is hardly a question in Horatian
ζ’ exegesis that is not raised by him, and raised, if at times in a form
rather more logical than befits the criticism of a poet, yet always
with a precision and strength, as well as with a fullness of know-
ledge, which at least (and it is an editor’s chief function) makes us
’ understand and measure the difficulty.

To the constructive criticism of previous centuries was added
in ''the present one the destructive criticism of which the chief
examples are to be found in the edition of H. Peerlkamp (Harlem,
ξ 1854; Amsterdam, 1862) and in the work of Gruppe, Minos: iiber
die Interpolationen in den romischen Dichtern‚ Leipzig, 1859.
ξ This, like the former, proposes to carry us back beyond the age of
MSS. or Scholia z unlike the former, it cannot even appeal to indi-
ζ, cations of disturbance in the MSS. which would explain, if they did
⁵ not require, its theories. The antecedent *probability of defects in
r the archetype wrongly filled up cannot be denied in the face of evi-
? dence that such defects must actually have existed: it becomes
’ a question of less or more. But the antecedent probability of the

suppositions which are necessary to any theory of the interpolation
, of spurious Odes or parts of Odes cannot be so easily granted.
Every known fact in the history of Horace’s poems can be ex-
plained without such a theory, unless indeed· ⁴it be assumed that no

poem or stanza which falls below his highest poetical level can be
