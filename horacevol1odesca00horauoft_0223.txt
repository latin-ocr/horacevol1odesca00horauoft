-. called honey ἔννατον μέρος τῆς ἀμβροσίας. And the Scholiast, on
Pind. Pyth. 9. 116, says that· honey had been said to be δέκατον
ξ μέρος τῆς ἀθανασίας. It is possible that Horace may have had
<gs some such words in his head in giving this numerical ratio of the
'³- sweetness of Lydia's lips, Another suggestion to which Orelli
3 inclines, is that he is thinking of Pythagoras' division of the
{7² elements, earth, air, fire, water, and ether, the πέμπτον ὅν, πέμπτη
οὐσία, ‘quinta essentia,’ the most perfect element3 so that ‘quinta
’ξ pars ’ will mean the ‘ purest and best' of her nectar. This is the
²3 proper meaning of the word ‘quintessence’ which was adopted,
Α with other words of the Pythagorean philosophy, by the Alchemists‚
,ι and passed from their use of it into common language.

that ‘citius’ is used for ‘citius quam,’ as ‘amplius' and ‘ plus’;
‘neque enim plus septima ducitur aestaS‚' Virg. G. 4. 207; or that
'the ablative does double duty, as the ablative of comparison and of
the point of time. Cp. Od. 4. 14. 13 ‘ plus vice simplici.⁷

ODE XIV

ammarum-..f -...-. ,a

,⁷ THE ship addressed has just escaped from a storm‚ its mast
broken, its hull shattered, its sails in ribands. The harbour is in
sight. The wind is rising'again. It is warned not to drift back
Ἴ into a sea in which it cannot live.

Quintilian (8. 6. 44) makes the Ode his illustration of the meaning
of the term ‘ allegoria': ⁴ Ut ‘⁴ O navis referent‚'' &c., totusque ille
Horatii locus quo navem pro republica, fluctuum tempestates pro
bellis civilibus, portum pro pace atque concordia dicit! And the

,poem of Alcaeus, which looks like its model, was believed by
the ancients to be an allegorical description of the political troubles
ᾗ of Mytilene :—
ἀσυνέτημι τῶν ἀνέμων στάσιν·
τὸ μὲν γὰρ ἔνθεν κῦμα κυλίνδεται,
τὸ δ’ ἔνθεν· ἄμμες δ’ ἂν τὸ μέσσον
vai· φορούμεθα σὺν μελαίνᾳ,
χειμῶνι μόχθεντες μεγάλῳ μάλα·
περ μὲν γὰρ ἄντλος ἱστοπέδαν ἔχει,
“ λαῖφος δέ πᾶν ζάδηλον ἤδη
καὶ λάκιδες μέγαλαι κατ’ miro.
χόλαισι δ’ ἄγκυραι . . .

(Fr. 18 Bergk.)

ᾼε long as we are content with Quintilian’s general exposition, all
is simple. The allegory is satisfied when the commonwealth, in
danger of relapsing into civil war, has become a sea-wearied ship,
