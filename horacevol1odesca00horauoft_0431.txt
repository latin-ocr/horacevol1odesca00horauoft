non, μηδ’ ὅν τινα γαστέρι μήτηρ Ι κοῦρον ἐόντα φέροι, μηδ’ ὃς φύγοι, ἀλλ’

Moenia!

ductos, either ‘carried along,’ ‘built,’ or only ‘traced.' See
Conington on Virg. Aen. 1. 423 ‘ pars ducere muros. ’

25. argutae, λιγείας, predicative. She learnt her clear singing,
as well as her harp- playing, of Apollo. Some MSS. of inferior
value have ‘Argivaess which was intended to be antithetical to

‘Dauniae' = ‘Latinae’ ; see note on ν. 28.

26. Xantho. The Lycian, not the Trojan, Xanthus· , 3. 4. 62.
Virg. Aen. 4. 143 ‘hibernam Lyciam Xanthique fluenta Deserit.'
For the practice of introducing into prayers the names of the sacred
haunts of the god addressed cp. 1. 30. 1, 3. 26. 10. Apollo'slong
hair 1s at once the sign of his perpetual youth (as m ν. 28‘ levis,'
i. e. ‘imberbis ’) and part of the costume of the bard; see Virg.
Aen. 1. 740‘ crinitus Iopas!

27. Dauniae, in the first place, doubtless, Horace’s own Muse
(cp. 3. 30. 10, and ‘ Calabrae Pierides’ of Ennius, 4. 8. 20), as is
shown by the immediate transition to himself, ‘spiritum Phoebus
mihi,' διο. But it is not a purely local designation. Horace would
not have said here ‘Venusinae Camenae! He speaks of ‘Daunian
blood' for Roman or Italian in Od. 2. 1. 34, and uses the Apulian
as the typical representative of all Roman virtues (Od. 3. 5. 9,
3. 16. 26, Epod. 2. 42); and so here the ‘Daunian Muse’ is the
‘Italian Muse,’ though he would remember the special appropriate-
ness of the local name, when the chosen representative of Roman
poetry is a Daunian born.

28. Agyieu. Ἀγυιεύς was a Greek name of Apollo as guardian
of ways, ἀγυιαί, Aesch. Agam. 1081, Arist. Vesp. 875. Ritter ex-
plains the choice of the title by the fact that the Carmen Saeculare
would be sung ‘sub dio! This seems far-fetched. The associa-
tions of the name were to Horace, probably, purely literary‚ and
his purpose, as in the first two lines of the stanza‚ is mainly to make
it clear that it is the Greek godin all his attributes whom he claims
as the protector of his Daunian Muse (the antithesis is present,
though we need not in v. 25 read‘ Argivae? to make it too ob-

“ »· trusive); and to this end the thoroughly Greek name contributes.
Cp. the force of a Greek form 1. 1. 34. The unusual name makes
great havoc among the copyists. V had oddly‘ Laetus Agylleu?

29, 30. These verses form the transition to the last part of the
Ode. He has pray ed to Phoebus, the Greek god of poetry, to
defend from disgrace, through failure of the poet or performers or
audience, the honour of the Italian Muse: ‘Yes, it is Phoebus that
inspires him; that teaches him his art; that gives him the fame
