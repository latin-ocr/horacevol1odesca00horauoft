our qualms and fears for Caesar’s welfare.'

to the Epodes. It has been usual to treat this Epode as written
when the news from Actium first reached Rome. Pliiss (following the
suggestion of Biicheler) has argued with great ingenuity and force
for the view that it was written at sea, for an extempore banquet on
board Maecenas' galley on the evening of the battle. He certainly
shows that the language suits best the theory of composition on or
near the spot. It is difficult to explain away ‘nauseam ' (v. 35).

, Even if it be in part metaphorical, it is most natural in the mouth

of one who has or has had the tossing ships before his eyes. The
emphasis on ‘ sub alta domo ’ points to a contrast with the writer's
position at the time. ‘ Quando ' in Horace's usage (⁴ O rus, quando
te aspiciam! ⁹) suggests a sigh rather than a question. Some ex-
pressions, as ‘ sinistrorsum citae,' find their most natural explanation
in the mouth of an eyewitness. The exactness of the moment
selected, when the battle is supposed to be over and the flight
known though its direction is only guessed, —the rapid change of
feelings, disgust‚ triumph, scarcely veiled anxiety—the precision

⁴ of some details combined with vagueness in the general picture,

all suit a writer close to the scene of action, who sees a part clearly
but not the whole, rather than one who hears the news at a dis-
tance. The omission of the event which forms so striking a
picture in the accounts of the battle by Plutarch and Dion, viz. the
burning of the Antonian ficet, is in any case unexplained. It might
perhaps be suggested that the Epode represents a moment before
the action itself‚ after the desertion of the Galatiam, and when the
delay in offering battle led to some premature rumour in the fleet
of Octavianus that Antony had fied. On the decisive question
whether Horace was actually present at Actium or not, we have no
conclusive evidence. If Maecenas was, Horace no doubt was also.
The professions of Epode 1, and the indications of this one then
fall into their place. They certainly raise a presumption that he
was. The fact ιε indeed distinctly asserted in the elegiae poem of
uncertain date‘ in obitum Maecenatis,' which was attributed, but
without sufficient evidence, to Ovid's friend, Pedo Albinovanus,
and it is vouched for by Acron on Epod. 1. It has been held to
be inconsistent with the statement of Dion (51. 3) that he was in
charge (pf Rome and Italy duling the campaign, but see the Introd.
