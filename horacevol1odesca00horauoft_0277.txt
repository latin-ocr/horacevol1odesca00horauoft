ODES. BOOK II

ODE I

‘ POLLIO is writing the tale of the civil wars, a difficult and
delicate task. We can afford to let even his tragedies wait awhile,
till the great and brave orator of the forum and the senate, and the
conqueror of Illyria, has given us his history. In our eagemess we
seem already to hear the trumpets and see the flashing armour,
to hear him reading to us of the fall of chieftains and the conquest ,
of all the world save Cato's stubborn soul. Ay, Jugurtha is avenged
now ! What land or sea is not red with the blood of our fratricidal
wars? But stay, my Muse, these are no themes for you.’

There is nothing to fix the date of the Ode. The expressions of
the two first stamas, ‘nondum expiatis‚’ ‘cineri doloso,’ attract it to
the Odes (such as 1. 2 and 14) which dwell more on the troubles
from which the State had already escaped, than on the new and
peaceful order on which it had entered. Octavianus is not men·
tioned. Pollio had not sided with him, and had certainly been
a friend of M. Antony. But the Ode expresses, as strongly as
Od. 1. 2, that weariness of bloodshed which had induced men
to acquiesce in the rule of one. ’

C. Asinius Pollio, the friend and supporter of Julius Caesar,
having passed through the Consulship in B.C. 40 (Virg. E. 4),
and won the honours of a triumph for his campaign against the
Illyrians (ib. 8. 6—13)‚ withdrew from public life, and, in the subse-

* quent struggle between Antony and Octavius, remained honourably

neutral. He was a magnificent patron of literature, and is famous
as having established the first public library at Rome out of the
spoils of his Illyrian campaign. He was also one of the most

κ accomplished men of the age. Catullus (12. 9) speaks of him in his
· youth as ‘leporum Disertus puer et facetiarum? He is ranked

among the great orators by Quintilian (10. 1. 113), Seneca (Epist.
100), and Tacitus (De Or. 38). His tragedies are spoken of in
high terms by Virgil (E. 8. 10 ‘sola Sophocleo tua carmina digna
cothurno ’) and Horace (Sat. Ι. 10. 42). His history of the civil
wars, from B.C. 60 to the establishment of Augustus’ power, is
referred to by Tacitus (Ann. 4. 34), Suetonius (Jul. 30).

We may notice the skill with which Pollio’s various accomplish-
ments are worked incidentally into the Ode.

1. motum, the stir of civil strife. Cicero's word sor a tumult or
rising, whether of a foreign or a domestic enemy.
