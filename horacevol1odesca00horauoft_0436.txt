THE oDEs OF HORACE

tilian (12. 10. 5) calls him ‘legum latorem’ in the art of painting,
and Pliny (N. H. 35. 36) praises him as the first who ‘ symmetriam
icturae dedit!

p Scopas, of Paros, belongs to the first half of the fourth century
Β. C.‚ being an elder contemporary of Praxiteles, and with him at
the head of the ‘later Attic school’ of sculpture, which is distin-
guished from the earlier school, of which Phidias was the re-
presentative.

8. ponere, to ‘represent,’ properly of sculpture3 to set up, to
leave standing before you. Cp. A. P. 34 ‘Infelix operis summa,
quia ponere toturn Nesciet,’ Od. 4. 1. 20 ‘ ponet marmoream,’ Virg.
E. 3. 46, and the correlative ‘ stare‚’ Sat. 2. 3. 183 ‘aeneus ut stes?

It is transferred to poetica] representation Juv.1. 155 ‘ Pone Tigel- . s

linum?

9. haee vis can hardly be (as Diintzerl -τ ‘harum deliciarum

vis,’ as ‘hederae vis’ 4. 11. 4, nor can ‘vis’ be used simply =
‘facultasss sc. ‘dandi talia,’ but it is used with a certain play, ‘this
is not where my force lies?

10. res . . . animum you are too rich to want such dainty
presents‚ too simple in your tastes to care for them.

12. pretium dicere muneri, i.e. tell you how much it is worth.
The construction as in Sat. 2. 3. 23 ‘ Callidus huic signo ponebam
milia centum‚' Ter. Hecyra Prol. 41 ‘ si numquam avare pretium
statui arti meae! The remainder of the Ode is occupied in setting
its value on the gift, i. e. in setting forth the ‘deathless powers’
that ‘to verse belong.’

13. notis publioiS, inscriptions graven by order of the State.
There seems to be an allusion to an act of Augustus (Suet. Oct. 31),
who had erected in his Forum statues of the great generals of the
Republic‚ with laudatory inscriptions.

1320. The general meaning of these lines is clear, though the
literature which they have occasioned ιε a sufficient proof that their
expression is somewhat confused. ‘ No other record of great deeds,
such as statues and inscriptions (which may be destroyed and
obliterated), not the great deeds themselves (which may be for·
gotten), can confer immortality of fame as poetry can! The
expression begins generally, as if he were going to talk of all great
generals; the second clause narrows it to Scipio Africanus Major.
The chief difficulty lies in v. 17. Attempts have been made to
explain that verse of the burning of the camp of Syphax by the
elder Scipio, Liv. 30. 5, or the burning of the Carthaginian ships
surrendered at the end of the Second Punic War, ‘quarum con-
spectum repente incendium [tradunt] tam lugubre fuisse Poenis
quam si tum ipsa Carthago arderet‚' Liv. 30. 433 and if Ennius
himself had used such a phrase, we might have explained it in one
of these ways as a natural exaggeration3 but, after the actual event,
the ‘burning of Carthage ’ in a Roman’s mouth can hardly mean
anything but its burning by Scipio Africanus Minor at the end of
the Third Punic War, in B. c. 146, seventeen years after the death
