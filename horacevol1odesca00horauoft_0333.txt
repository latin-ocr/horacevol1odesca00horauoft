cannot escape, though he may refuse ‘the death for his country
which is sweet and beautiful.' The verse seems like a translation
of Simonides (§ 65. ed. Bergk) ὁ δ’ αὖ θάνατος κίχε καὶ τὸν φυγό-
μα ον.

§if-um, used apparently with no emphasis, as ‘agrestium viro-
rum,' 3. 1. 21.

16. timido tergo, see on 1. 15. 19.

17-20. ‘The virtuous man cannot know the disgrace of defeat
(not merely he cannot be disgraced, he cannot be defeated). And
the honours (high offices) which he gains have no stain on them as
is the case with those gained m the Comitia. ² These two paradoxes
are explained by a third, ‘the consulship which he fills is neither
taken up nor resigned in accordance with the shifting wind of
popular favour) In the same strain Horace tells Lollius that his
soul is ‘ Consul non unius anni Sed quotiens bonus atque fidus
Iudex honestum praetulit utili‚’ 4. 9. 39. He has clothed in Roman
language the Stoic paradox that the wise man is always a king, cp.
Epp. 1. 1. 107, Sat. 1. 3. 136, and see on Od. 2. 2. 9. Compare
the exposition of it in Cicero, Acad. Quaest. 4. 44, and the anecdote
which he tells, ‘ Albinum qui tum praetor esset, cum Carneades et
Stoicus Diogenes ad Senatum in Capitolio starent, iocantem
Carneadi dixisse: Ego tibi praetor esse non videor quia sapiens
non sum . . . tum ille, Huic Stoico non videris.’

17. repulsae, the technical word for losing an election.

18. intaminatis, an ἅπαξ hey„ but formed naturally from the

. obsolete ‘tamino’ (Fest. s. v.), found in ‘ contamin0,' ‘ attamino.'

fulget, cp. 3. 16. 31 ‘ Fulgentem imperio fertilis Africae.'

20. popularis aurae, a common metaphor3 ‘ventus popularis‚'
Cic. Clu. 47. 130, ‘aura favoris popularis,’ Liv. 22. 26. In Virgil's
‘gaudens popularibus auris,’ Aen. 6. 817, the idea is of a favouring
wind, here it is of the changeableness of the wind. Compare the
uses of πνεῦμα and πνοή.

21. Compare the epigram of Simonides on those that fell with
Leonidas (ξ 98. ed. Bergk) Οὐδὲ τεθνᾶσι θανόντες, ἐπεί σφ’ ἀρετὴ
καθύπερθε Ι κυδαίνουᾶ ἀνάγει δώματος ἐξ Ἀΐδεω, Virg. Aen. 9. 641
‘ Macte nova ‘virtute, puer; sic itur ad astra‚' 6. 130 ‘ardens evexit
ad aethera virtus’ (with Conington’s note). It is here at least
only· an immortality of fame that' ιε promised. Cp. 3. 30. 6 ‘ Non
omnis moriar‚' 4. 8. 28 ‘Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori:
Caelo Musa beat,' with the verses before and aster.

22. negat-a,‘ pennis non homini datisss 1. 3. 35. There is no
way, but Virtue makes one. Qvid, probably imitating this, Met.
14.113 ‘ Invia virtuti nulla est via!

temptat iter, probably from Virg. G. 3. 8 ‘Temptanda via est
qua me quoque possim Tollere humo,' as that ιε from Ennius.

23. udam, opp. to ‘liquidum aethera,' 2. 20. 2, &c.

25. The sels· restraint that can keep a secret is praised as one of
the old Roman virtues. Compare 1. 18. 16‘ arcani Fides prodiga,'
Sat. 1. 4. 84 ‘ commissa tacere Qui nequit, hic niger est,‘ διο. and

w. n. ι. ’ 145 L
