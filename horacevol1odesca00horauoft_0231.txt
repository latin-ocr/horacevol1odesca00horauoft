Aen. 1. 15, 7. 735, ὅτε. Cp. Od. 1. 7. 23, 3. 5. 41, 3. 20. 13.

14. undique, from every animal3 A. P. 3 ‘Undique collatis

Δ , membris! The Schol. Cruq. adds (possibly from an older com-

mentator, and so conceivably from some quer version of the

Ι ¹ legend), ‘ Sic timorem deprompsit a lepore, a vulpe astutiam!

16. vim, to be taken closely with ‘insani,' which defines its

ζ meaning, ‘the force of the lion’s fury.'

stomacho, the seat of anger, see on Od. 1. 6. 6.

17. Thyesten. Thyestes stands as the representative of the
crimes of passionate revenge in Greek Tragedy. Cp. Od. 1. 6. 8
‘ Saevam Pelopis domum?

18. ultimae, the furthest off, the first link of the chain. Ritter

⁴ quotes Virg. Aen. 7. 49 ⁴ tu sanguinis ultimus auctor.'

19. stetere. By the variation from the usual ‘ exstitere,’ Horace
clearly wishes to feel again something of a living metaphor in the
verb, though it is not quite evident what the metaphor is. Cp.
Virg. Aen. 7. 553 ‘stant belli causae! There it seems to be ‘they
are on foot, in full life and strength, there is no need to use any
more efforts to arouse them.’ Here perhaps the verb cannot be
alltoge'ther separated from ‘ultimae’ The succession stopped in

20. imprimeret muris aratrum, to plough the site os a con-
quered city was a token (or a metaphor) of its total destruction:
Prop. 4. 9. 41 ‘Moenia cum Graio Neptunia pressit aratro Victor
Palladiae ligneus artis equus.' Cp. Aesch. Ag. 526.

22. me quoque, as well as the rest of the world, as it may you.

dulei iuventa, ‘so sweet,' says Dillr„ ‘that one can think of
nothing else, its pleasures make one careless’3 cp. Od. 1. 37. 11
‘dulci fortuna ebria.' Orelli thinks it is only the fondness with

, which a man, as he grows old, looks back on his youth, and pleads ‚

³ for it even while he recounts its errors.

24. celeris, ‘hasty,' ‘impetuous'3 cp. Epp. 1. 18. 89 ‘oderunt
. . . sedatum celeres'; but there is some force in giving the epithet
to the ‘ iambi,’ rather than to himself. He would suggest that his

ῒ Pegasus ran away with him.

26. tristia, perhaps with reference to v. 9. Here, as contrasted
with ‘mitibus,' it carries more distinctly a metaphor of taste‚ as
Virg. G. 2. 126 ‘tristes suci ' ; G. 1. 75 ‘triste lupinum!
