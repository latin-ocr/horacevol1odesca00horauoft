THE ODES OF HORACE

neither ‘fountain-head ’ (Virg. Aen. 1. 245) nor ‘mouth’ (Virg. G.
4. 292) is a meaning which would bear pressing here.

10. audaces covers, probably, boldness of treatment and of
tzopes, besides the two points afterwards named—vocabulary and
r ythm.

nova verba, novel words, long compounds. τῶν δ’ ὀνομάτων τὰ ,
μὲν διπλᾶ μάλιστα ἁρμόττει τοῖς διθυράμβοις, Arist. Poet. 22. 14.

11. devolvit, as the torrent rolls boulders down its bed. .

12. lege solutis. Two technical expressions possibly contribute ς’
to the full force of this phrase: (1) ‘legibus solutus,’ said of any one
exempted from the operation of any law (Cic. Phil. 2. 13. 31), in later ,
times of the emperor as above the laws (Merivale, vol. iii, p. 466); Σὲ
(2) ‘soluta oratio‚’ the common designation of prose, as exempt ξ’
from strict laws of prosody3 so that the words of the text form ’
a sort of oxymoron, ‘ verse which is as free of law as is it were not ’
verse? '

13. regesque. The kings, as the following words explain, of Α
mythology — Pirithous, Theseus, Bellerophon, not the kings of ξ·
Pindar's day. He is speaking of Hymns and Paeans. ‘ Que' is ξ
the reading of all the best MSS. as against the vulg. ‘ ve‚’ and the ³
change would hardly be necessary, even if it were clear that Pindar’s
Odes on the mythical exploits of demigods were classed under a
'dlifferent name from those addressed to gods. Horace might rank ξ
t ern to ether. ³·

17. Εῗθα palma. The Olympian Odes are taken as representa· ’
tives of the ἐπινίκια.

18. caelestis, ‘ very denizens of heaven '; see on 1. 1. 6 ‘ terrarum

. dominos evehit ad deos.’

equum, as Pindar makes mention of Pherenicus‚ Hiero’s horse,
Ol. 1. 18, Pyth. 3. 74; but singing of horses may well mean of ,
their riders. ἰ

19. potiore signis. Pindar makes the comparison himself, ,-
Nem. 5. 1 οὐκ ἀν νδριαντοποιός εἶμι. .ἀλλὰ γλυκεῖ’ ἀοιδὰ στεῖχ dn· J

ve varies the ‘ sive,’ ‘ sive‚' of the last two stanzas, although he
is adding a fresh department of poetry, viz. the θρῆνοι. Cp. 1. 22. 1
5—7‘ sive. ‚sive. ..'vel ς

22, 23. For the elision at the end of the verses cp. 2. 2. 18,2. 16. ἒ
34, C. S. 47, and Index of Metres, ξ 3. ,

23. aureos is predicative,‘ as all golden’ ; cp. 1. 5. 9. The ξ
double contrast of the bright stars above, the gloomy shades below, ⁴
is indicated by the verb ‘educit‚’ on one side, by the adjective
‘ nigro ' on the other.

educit. in astra, as ‘ Musa vetat mori: Caelo Musa beat‚’ 4. 8.
28, of immortality in fame.

25. multa aura3 there is no fear of his falling; the free and
buoyant winds of heaven are beneath him as he soars into the
upper air. Horace contrasts Pindar’s higher flights and original ·-
