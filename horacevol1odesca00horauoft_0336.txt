THE ODES OF HORACE

14. vexere, evidently, from the context, in his triumphal ascent
to heaven. Compare Propertius’ account (3. 17. 8) of the apotheosis
of Ariadne, ‘ Lyncibus in caelum vecta Ariadna tuis.² The tamed
tigers are not only an ornamental appendage, they are emblems of
the civilizing labours, his ‘just purpose firmly kept,' whereby he
merited deification. These are recognized also probably in ythe

‘pater,' although this was a common Roman address to gods. Cp.
Od. 1. 18. 6, Epod. 2. 22, Epp. 1. 16. 59, 2. 1. 5, and see Conington
on Vir . G. 2. 4.

15. gairinus. For the story of his translation see Ovid, Fast.
2. 481 foll.

17. The gods are represented as sitting in council on the question
whether Romulus shall be admitted to their number. Juno, to the
pleasure of all, assentS.

18. Ilion, Ilion, ‘ It was Troy that 1 hated‚ and Troy is de-
stro ed.’

19y. fatalis (cp. Δύσπαρις-Αἷνόπαρις), ‘-d00m fraught? The two
epithets are meant to have a close connexion.

iudex‚‘ manet alta mente repostum Iudicium Paridis? Virg. Aen.
1. 26. The epithet‘ incestus‘ is fitly applied to him as ‘iudexss
inasmuch as his judgement was determined by Venus’ promise,
τὴν δ’ ᾖνησ’ ἥ οἷ πόρε μαχλοσύνην ἀλεγεινήν, Hom. Il. 24. 30.

20. mulier peregrina. There is a scornful emphasis in the
manner in which Juno refuses to name Helen or Paris.

vertit: in pulverem, reduced to dust, Gr. ἀμαθύνειν, as Hom. Il.

21. ex quo, construet ‘damnatum ex qu0,’ &c. The sentence
was passed at the time of Laomedon's fraud3 it was executed in
Priam’s time ; so the ‘dux' of v. 24 must be Laomedon. For the
story of his cheating Apollo and Neptune of their bargained wages
for building the walls of Troy see Hom. Il. 23. 442 foll.

22. mercede pacta, an abl. absol„ ‘promised them wages and .

then sailed them ’ ; or it may be as Fore. takes it, after the analogy
of the ablative with ‘ fraudare,’ e. g. ‘ praeda,' Liv. 2. 42.

mihi damnatum = ‘addictum,' given over for punishment, as ,

Virg. Aen. 4. 699 ‘ Stygioque caput damnaverat Orco.'

A 23. castae, ‘ bene autem “ castae,’' quia “incestus iudex ’' dixerat,'
ξφ fraudulento, the epithet is meant for people and prince

alike. ‘ Laomedonteae periuria Troiae,’ Virg. G. 1. 502, cp. Aen.

4⁶ 2332& Paris, the cause of the war, and Hector, the bulwark of

Troy, are dead.

25. adulterae, probably the dative with ‘ splendet} ‘adorns ζ’

himself for the eyes οἷ’, 1. 5. 4 ‘cui religas comam? With
‘’splendet Cp. Hom. Il. 3. 392 κάλλεΐ τε στίλβων και εἵμασιν.
26. famosus, ofev1lnotor1ety as in 3. 15 3, Sat. 1. 4. 5.
hospes, the relation that gave its chief infamy to Paris’ crime,
ᾔσχυνε ξενίαν τράπεζαν κλοπαῖσι γυναικός, Aesch. Ag. 401.
