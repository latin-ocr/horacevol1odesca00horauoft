INTRODUCTION 'ro THE
CA RME N SAECULAR E

v IN the Mon. Ancyranum (Mommsen, c. 22) Augustus tells us that
he celebrated the Secular Games in the consulship of C. Furnius
> and C. Silanus (13.c. 17) with Agrippa as colleague, and on behalf
ἑ of the ‘college of Quindecimviri!
Suetonius (Oct. 31) mentions the ‘Ludi Saeculares’ amongst

(see Burn’s Rome and the Campagna, p. 300), the locality of some
of the chief ceremonies even in Augustus’ celebration,
Their origin according to some of the authorities, according to

· others their second celebration, was ascribed to Val. Publicola. All
³ agree that they had only been celebrated four times before the age
ἑ, of Augustus. ‘There is no trace of the name ‘ Saeculares' before
> that date, and what is said of the different celebrations goes to
J show that they were called forth by special emergendes, not by any
ἶ recurrence of epochs. Still, there would seem to have been some
tradition of such recurrence to justify Augustus’ revival. On the
dates of the* celebrations Censorinus' authorities differed. The
