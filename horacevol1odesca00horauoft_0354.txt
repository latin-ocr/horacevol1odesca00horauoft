THE ODES OF HORACE

the genitive after the analogy of ‘ integer vitae,’ ‘captus animi, ’.&c
‘ Capite deminutus est qui in hostium potestatem venit} Fest. It
is in Horace's manner, by a slight alteration of the common
formula, at once to recall and to avoid a technicality which, if
literally reproduced, would be harsh or pedantic. (See on 2. 4. 24,
4. 2..42‚ 4. 14. 1, and compare notes on 3. 27. 38, 4. 15. 9. He
refused, according to Cicero, ‘sententiam dicere,’ ‘to speak in. his
place, ’ ‘quamdiu iureiurando hostium teneretur non esse se sena·
torem!

44. Ar. Ran. 804 ἔβλεψεν ουν ταυρηδὸν ἐγκυψας κάτω.

45. donee. ..firmaret ‘ Till he could brace up the resolve of
the fathers and hasten his departure; ·' ‘donec’ of purpose3 but
a contrast is intended between his stern sadness, so long as it was
still doubtful whether the senate would listen to his counsel, and
the light heart with which, his purpose accomplished, he set out on
his return to torture and death.

46. auctor is opposed constantly to‘ suasor! Sometimes as one
who brings weUight and dignity to back his advice; sometimes
as one who originates as well as urges a proposal. The senate
{ctedl‘auctore Regulo‚' ‘by the advice and under the influence of

egu us

48. egregius exsul, an oxymoron, as ‘splendide mendax‚’3. 11. 35.

49. atqui sciebat. Cp. the last sentence of the passage quoted
in the Introd. from the De Officiis, ‘Neque vero tum ignorabat
[Regulus] se ad crudelissimum hostem et ad exquisita supplicia
proficisci, sed iusiurandum conservandum putabat?

52. reditus, plural, as in Epod. 16. 35.

54. diiudicata lite. Cp. Epp. 1. 7. 76‘ Rura suburbana indictis

‚ire Latinis. ’ The advice and protection of clients is represented
as one of the great burdens of the city life of the great in Rome.
(Epp. 1. 5. 31 ‘postico falle clientem,’ διο.) Whether the ‘lis,’
which is now over, is one which the patron has heard and settled
himself, or one in which he has been supporting his client in court,

is a question decided authoritatively each way by about an equal ,Ᾰ

number of Commentators, but apparently on next to no evidence.

55. Venafranoe, see on 2. 6. 16.

56. Lacedaemonium, 2. 6. 11 ‘regnata Laconi Rura Phalanto.’
Venafrum and Tarentum are named as places to which a Roman
would go for his holiday. Notice the quiet ending of the poem,
the conventional epithet, raising no new picture, appealing at the

most to distant historical associations, feeding not so much the ,’

mind as the ear, and even that with a certain sameness of sound.
This characteristic of Horace' 5 style is noticed on Od.2. 19. 31,

4. 2. 57. It belongs partly to himself, partly to the poetic art ὲ
generally. It finds instinctive expression in the ending of the Iliad ἐ
as in that of Paradise Lost. The passion in poetry which gives
pleasure is not unbridled passion, but passion felt to be measured -

and controlled by mind. This is the intellectual side of the pleasure
added to poetry by the recurrenees of rhyme and metre-
