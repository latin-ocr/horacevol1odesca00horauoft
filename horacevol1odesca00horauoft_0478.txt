THE EPODES OF HORACE

89. dirius curses,’ as in the passage of Tacitus quoted on v. 85.
dira detestatio, the solemn denunciation of a curse.

92. Furor seems to be used as a masculine form of Furia. For

the idea of the passage cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 385.

94. deorum manium, the spirits of the dead31iterally, according ζ

to Curtius, Grundz. p. 294, the‘ good' powers, ‘manis’ being the 'i

opposite of‘ immanis? Cp. Cic. de Leg. 2. 9 ‘Deorum manium

iura sancta sunto. Hos leto datos divos habento?

100. Esquilinae, the birds of carrion that haunted the‘ campus i

Esquilinus: still the‘ miserae plebis commune sepulchrssum Sat.1

8. 10. For the hiatus, the diphthong being shortened‚ cp. Sat. 1. 9.
38‘ Si me amas inquit? and such instances in Virgil as Aen. 3. 211 ι

‘Insulae Ionio,' &Q

EPODE VI

‘YOU are like a watch- -dog who flies at a guest but is afraid of ‘³
a wolf. Turn your impotent attack on me: I have teeth; I follow ἑ
my quarry to the death. You bark loud enough, but will turn aside s
for a piece of meat. Beware,1 am a bull with sharp horns‚ and ζ
ready to attack those who deserve it, as ready· as Archilochus or ξ

Hipponax. I will not take an insult.'

In assailing the wrong use of the poetry of invective, Horace
indicates its right use. The misuser of iambic verse attacks the
innocent and desenceless‚ and is ready to be bought off. What
can we wish better than that he should yprovoke the true wielder of
ssrdglofhus’ weapon and be the obJect instead of the writer of an

po e Ρ

The person intended is not known. Acron calls him‘ Cassium
maledicum poetam! The Comm. Cruq. further identifies him with
Cassius Severus, an orator of name (Quint. 10.1. 177), but a
libellous writer (Tac. Ann. 1. 72). He is known to have died
Α. D. 32, and it is perhaps hardly probable that he can have written
lampoons such as to attract Horace's anger (as this would oblige
us to suppose) at the least sixty-three years before. Nor is there

any hint elsewhere of his having been a poet. Ritter suggests ·
Furius Bibaculus, who is elsewhere ridiculed by Horace (see on ·

Sat. 1. 10. 37, 2. 5. 41), and who is classed with Catullus by Quin-
tilian (10. 1. 96) as a writer of bitter ‘iambi‚’ ‘[iambi] cuius
acerbitas in Catullo, Bibacu10‚ non in Horatio reperietur,' and who
is named by Tac. Ann. 4. 34 as a lampooner of the Caesarian

family.

1. Compare Cicero’s comparison of accusers to watch· ·dogs who
are apt to bark at the wrong persons, pro Rosc. Am. 20. 57. Cp.
also Horace’s expression for w-ell directed satire, Sat. 2. 1. 84⁴ Si
quis Opprobriis dignum latraverit.’
