ODE XXXVII

· A SONG of triumph, written when the news reached Rome, in
² September, Β. c. 30, of the death of Cleopatra and Antony (Dion 51. .

ἰ 19). Compare Epod. 9, which celebrates their defeat at Actium in
J? the preceding year. We may note the absence from both Ode and
Epode (see esp. on v. 13) of the name of Antonius. Octavianus

has conquered not a Roman rival, but a foreign enemy: ‘ Senatus

ζ Cleopatrae, non Antonio, bellum indixerat (Dion 50. 6): de illa
Δ triumphum non de hoc- decrevit (Dion 51. 19).' Ritter.

‘ Now is the time for merriment and thanksgiving, private and
public; now, and not before, while the great queen was plotting
wild schemes of destruction against Rome. Her madness was
cooled at the sight of her fleet in flames. Blind panic became

reasonable terror when she fied before Caesar as a dove before ·

a hawk. Yet she was no vulgar woman. She could brave out her
fortune, and look death in the face rather than adorn a Roman
triumph.’ As Horace paints the fierce barbaric queen, her reck-

’ lessness and her fortitude, he is bringing out in stronger relief the
ς danger from which Rome has been freed, and the glory of Octavianus,

’Ξ who has conquered no unworthy foe.

,² I have noticed (Introduction to Odes i-iii, ξ 13) the important
place assigned to this Ode, at the end of the Book. It gives

Horace's second ground* for acquiescing in the supremacy of

Octavianus. The alternative, as time went on, had been seen to be

, not a restoration of the constitution as Brutus conceived it, but (as

' a choiee of masters) ‘Antony with Cleopatra and an orientalized

> court. See also add1t10nal note to Od. 3. 3.

·. The opening of the Ode was doubtless modelled on the Ode of
Alcaeus upon the death of Myrsilus (Fr. 20, Bergk), of which we

-. have two lines preserved in Athen. x. p. 430, A :—

νῦν χρὴ μεθύσθην καί τινα πρὸς βίαν
πίνην, ἐπειδὴ κάτθανε Μύρσιλος.

1. libero, all restraint on our joy is removed. For dancing as an

⁷· expression of joy see Od. 1. 36. 123 for the expression, ‘ pulsanda
tellus,’ Od. 1. 4. 7 ‘quatiunt terram’3 3. 18. 15 ‘pepulisse ter pede

Ἰ terram.'

4. tempus erat, ‘ we were right to wait; this was the time.’ In
such uses of the imperfect there is always reference to some past
thought, though the relation of the thought to the leading state-
