BOOK 11, ODE 11, 5-8—ODE 111

14. neo sitim . . . languor, ‘drinking increases the disease3 it
cannot quench the thirst till the malady which causes the thirst is
gone, and with it the other symptoms.’ The application of the
analogy is evident. Cp. 3. 16. 17 ‘ Crescentem sequitur cura
pecuniam. Maiorumque fames.² Ovid reproduces the comparison‚

’ Fast. 1. 212 ‘quum possideant plurima plura petunt: Sic quibus

· intumuit suffusa venter ab unda Quo plus sunt potae plus sitiuntur
a uae.'

quisi . . . venis. They speak of drinking as though it immediately
filled the veins, Sat. 2. 4. 25 ‘ vacuis committere venis Nil nisi lene
decet'3 of thirst as though it were felt in the veins, Virg. G. 3. 482
‘venis omnibus acta sitis! So the meaning is, ‘no pouring into
the veins will cure the thirst ; there is something that must be got
rid of out of them—some inner malady in the recesses of the body.'

15. aquosus languor, ‘ the faintness caused by the water.'

17. redditum cyri solio, cp. 3. 29. 27 ‘regnata Cyro Bactra.’
It is the most distinct enunciation of that identity of the Parthian
with the Persian monarchy which Horace assumes elsewhere. See
on Od. 1. 2. 22. For the historical event referred to see Introd. to

S 19. Virtus, the personified judgement os a virtuous man, as in
at. 1. 3. 42.

f l20i dedocet, ‘would fain unteach the people to use names
agzy22. tutum, propriam, predicative, a diadem, and a laurel
crown that cannot be taken away again. Cp. 3. 2. 17—20.

23. oculo irretorto, ‘who can see huge treasure-heaps, and
never turn to look again!

24. acervos, more fully in Epp. 1. 2. 47 ‘ aeris acervus et auri)

ODE III

‘LET the thought of death moderate both repining in trouble
and exultation in prosperity. Enjoy yourself while you may, for

orn.

Some little doubt hangs over the name of the person to whom
these counsels of Epicureanism are addressed. The old Blandinian
MS. gave it as ‘ Gellius! Cruquius identifies him with L. Gellius
Publicola, the brother (half brother through their mother, or brother
by adoption, according to different theories) of Messalla (Od. 3. 21.
7), and consul Β. C. 36.

Dellius (as the other good MSS. and the MSS. of Acr. and
Porph. write the name) would no doubt be Q. Dellius, who had
