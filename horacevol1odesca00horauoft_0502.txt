ΟΝ ΤΗΕ UNKNOWN NAMES IN THE ODES

in the Ionic a minore metre of 3. 12. With one or two exceptions ·

the unknown male names in the Odes (the names of Horace’s
rivals, as in 1. 13, on any theory of a real Lydia) are Greek names,
Telephus, Gyges, Calais; mythological names3 sometimes the
names of Greek rivers, Hebrus 3. 12, Enipeus 3. 7. We may add

perhaps that where the designation is most full and precise we '

seem to see most definitely the purpose of giving momentary sub·-
stance to an acknowledged shadow3 see on ‘Thurini Calais filius
Ornyti ’ 3. 9. 14, and cp. Introd. to 2. 4. In a few cases we seem
to see the appropriation of the name to a special character, as
‘CyruS,’ 1. 17. 25, 1. 33. 63 ‘ Pholoe,’ 1. 33. 7, 9, 2. 5. 17, 3. 15. 7;
‘Telephus,’ 1. 13. 1, 3. 19. 26, 4. 11. 21. On the other hand, the
same name is at times given to people of such different characters
or ages, that those who gave them real existence were obliged to
recognize more than one owner of the name3 cp. the Phyllis of 2.
4 and 4. 11, the Chloris of 2. 5 and 3. 15, the Lalage of 1. 22 and
2. 5. There are cases where a reality seems to be given to unknown
names by their being brought into close relation with real persons
and events, such as ‘ Mystes,’ the lost friend of Valgius, in 2. 93
‘Glycera,’ to whom Tibullus is supposed to write piteous elegies‚
1. 33. In this last case, however, we note that Glycera is not
a name that occurs in Tibullus’ extant elegies. How much truth
of fact underlies the very few love-Odes in which Horace's own
personality is introduced (otherwise than by the mere use of the
first person) such as 1. 33, ‘ Ipsum me melior cum peteret Venus,

Grata detinuit compede Myrtale ¹,’ or 4. 11 in which, after inviting ’

Phyllis to help him keep Maecenas’ birthday, he addresses her as
‘ meorum finis amorum,' it is more difficult to say.

There is one name, that of Cinara (Od. 4. 1. 4, 4. 13. 21, 22,
Epp. 1. 7. 28, 1. 14. 33), which seems redeemed from a mere
shadowy existence, both by the personal feelings that seem to
accompany its mention and by its recurrence among the remini-
scences of the poet’s own life in the Epistles. That a mere literary
reminiscence, an echo of his amatory poems rather than of his
feelings, is intended seems unlikely in the absence of the nane
from all his early poemS.

What has been said will obviously not apply with equal force to

the Epodes, where, in idea at least, personality is the essence of

the poem. The introduction of Horace’s own name, as in Epod.
15, and the pursuance of his attack upon Canidia through three
Epodes and three Satires seem to indicate real and definite objects.
But the use of poetical names for characters who have no existence
save at the moment begins doubtless in the Epodes, as do other·
features of the OdeS.
