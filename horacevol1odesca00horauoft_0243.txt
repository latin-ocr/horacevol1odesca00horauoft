BOOK 1, ODE XXII, 1—23

13. portentum, i. e. the wolf, τέρας, πέλωρον; not that to See
a wolf there was such a wonder, but he means to express the shock
which the sight gave him, and half playfully turns the wolf into
a monster.

militaris, ‘the land of soldiers,' is chiefly a complimentary epithet
to the poet’s birth-place, cp. 3. 5. 9 ‘ sub rege Medo Marsus et
Apulus ’; 2. 1. 34 ‘ Dauniae caedes? All other Roman excellences

” are in the same way attributed to the Apulians, industry and hard-

ness to the men, housewifely virtues to the women, Od. 3. 16. 26,
Epod. 2. 42. A comparison, however, of 1. 17. 9 (see note there)

ἦ suggests that there is some connexion of thought between the size
ῗζ- of the wolves and the soldierly character of the inhabitants.

14. Daunias, Apulia; so called, according to Festus, from Daunus,
an Illyrian prince who settled in it and became the son—in-law of

’ Diomede, see on Od. 3. 30. 11. ‘ Daunias‚' is a Greek form, not

found elsewhere in Horace, but not uncommon in Ovid; cp.
‘Ambracias terra‚’ Her. 13. 164, δια, though more usually with

Greek names and in an adjective. For Apulian wolves, cp. Od. ,

1. 1353I7ubae tellus. Augustus restored to the younger Juba, in

.; Β. c. 30, the kingdom of Numidia, which had been forfeited by his
, father, the elder Juba, who fought at Thapsus on the side of Scipio

and Cato, and slew himself after their defeat. In B. C. 25 Juba
surrendered Numidia, which became a Roman province, and
received instead of it Mauretania with some tribes of the Gaetuli to
the south of it. As ‘ Gaetulus ’ is a common epithet of lions (see
on the next Ode, v. 10), it has been supposed that this is a passing
allusion to this exchange, and that ‘Juba’s new territory’ gives

, a date to the Ode.

17—24. ‘ Place me in the frigid zone or in the torrid (cp. Od. 3. 3.
55ι Quap arte debacchentur ignes, Qua nebulae pluviique rores ’)
1 care notp,1 shall still be safe, still light· -Jhearted

17. pigris, ἀργοῖς, of the dull deadness of winter; ‘bruma
iners,’ Od. 4. 7. 12; Lucret. 5. 745 ‘ Bruma nives affert pigrumque

- rigorem!

nulla arbor recreatur, i.e. there is no tree to be woke to life
again by the breezes of summer, the ‘ genitabilis aura F avoni?

19. malus Iuppiter, see on Od. 1. 1. 2 5.

22. domibus negata, unfit for human habitation‚ opp. to the
temperate zones, which are ‘mortalibus aegris Munere concessae
divum,’ Virg. G. 1. 237.

23. dulce ridentem, from Sapp ho’s ἁδὺ φωνείσας.. ,καὶ γελαίσας

’ ἱμερόεν. Catullus, in his imitation of that Ode (51. 5), has ‘dulce

ridentem.' For the construction compare 2.12.14 ‘lucidum
fulgentis’ 3 2. 19. 6‘ turbidum laetatur 3. 27. 67⁴ perfidum ridens‚’

&c. ‘ Lalagen’ takes us back to the wolf and v.10: ‘I shall be
the same Horace still, free from care and thinking of Lalage, and
safe in being the same.’ Horace doubtless felt the play on the name
of ‘prattling’ Lalage (λαλεῖν) ; cp. Od. 1. 33. 2 ‘immitis Glycerae.’
