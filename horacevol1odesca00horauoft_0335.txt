BOOK III, ODE ΙΙ, 25-ODE ΙΙΙ, 12

3. vultus, as τὸ σὸν δείσας πρόσωπον, Soph. O. T. 448.

4. mente is the ablative of the part affected.

solida, ‘rock- like'3 the metaphor is interpreted in Sen. de
Consol. Sap. 3 ‘Quemadmodum proiecti in altum scopuli mare
frangunt ita sapientis animus solidus est! Simonides' τετράγωνος
ἄνευ ψόγου, which commentators quote, is not in point, for it refers
to the perfection, not as this does to the firmness, of the wise man’ 5
mind.

5. dux, as ‘arbiter Hadriae‚’ 1. 3. 15.

turbidus, the captain is as disorderly as his crew.

7. orbis seems to mean ‘the round sky' ; cp.1.16. 11 ‘nec
saevus ignis nec tremendo Iuppiter ipse ruens tumultu,’ Theogn.
869* εν μοι ἔπειτα πέσοι μεγας οὐρανὸς εὐρὺς ὕπερθεν, Lucan 2. 290, in
the same connexion as this,‘ Sidera quis mundumque velit spectare
cadentem Expers ipse metus? quis curn ruit arduus aether . . .
Complosas tenuisse manus ?'

9-15. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 5-12 ‘Romulus et Liber pater et cum
Castore Pollux‚’ &c., where Augustus is ranked with the same
mythological benefactors of mankind, but distinguished from them
as having received his apotheosis in his lifetime, while theirs was
delayed by envy till after their death. See also the comments
passed (Tac. Ann. 4. 38) on Tiberius’ refusal to accept divine
honours, ‘ Optimos quippe mortalium altissima cupere; sic Hercu-
lede et Liberum apud Graecos, Quirinum apud nos deum nurnero
a itos.'

9. arte, cp ‘veteres artis,'4. 1512.

vagus, πολύπλαγκτος, Virg. Aen. 6. 801 ‘ N ec vero Alcides tantum
telluris obivit,' where note that the travels of Hercules and Bacchus
are mentioned to be compared with the progress of Augustus in
the East.

10. enisus. It is the usual word for struggling upwards, as
Virg. G. 2. 360, of the climbing vine.

arces igneas, for the meaning of‘ arces’ see on 2. 6. 22:

‘igneas,’ ‘’starry, as Horace calls the stars ‘ignes‚’ Od. 1. 12. 473
cp. Ovid's ‘ siderea arx,' Am. 3. 10. 21.

attigit, see on 1. 3. 10.

12. purpureo ore, as ‘roseo ore’ of Venus, Virg. Aen. 2. 593,
though attributed to only one feature, it implies the halo of rosy light
which surrounds the beatified Augustus. ‘Candidus insuetum
miratur limen Olympi,’ Virg.. E. 5. 56, of the apotheosis of
Daphnis.

bibet, al. ‘bibit.' The future has the best authority, and it is in
accordance with the picture in Virg. G. 1. 24 foll. and 503 where
the apotheosis is spoken of as future. ‘Bibit' would represent
him as a god already. This is not in itself impossible. cp. Od. 4.
5. 31-36 and Ep pp 2. 1. 15 foll. But' in that case we should expect

‘recubans': he would be pictured as at table. ‘recumbens bibet’=
‘will take his place at table and drink.' The place 1s kept for him,
but not yet occupied.
