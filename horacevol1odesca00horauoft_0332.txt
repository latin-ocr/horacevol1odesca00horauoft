THE ODES OF HORACE

sense as well as grammar ; but the hypallage which makes ‘ sidere
clarior’ agree with ‘usus’ rather than with ‘purpurarum' (cp. 3.
21. 19 ‘iratos regum apices‚’ and Epod. 10. 12 and 14), is the same
as that by which Virgil attributes to the ‘ usus olivi ' the adultera-
tion which happened to the oil itself.

44. Achaemenium, Persian. See on 2. 12. 21.

45. invidendis, 2. 10. 7 ‘caret invidenda Sobrius aula.’

novo ritU‚ ‘after the modern fashion.’ Cp. Od. 2. 15. 10-20,
2. 18. 1-5. The ‘ atrium' was the reception-room of a great house
(cp. Epp. 1. 5. 31 ‘Atria servantem postico falle clientem’)‚ and
the chief care was spent on its adomment ; so that the ideas of the
two lines will be exactly parallel to Virg. G. 2. 461-463 ‘Si non
ingentem foribus domus alta superbis Mane salutantum totis vomit
aedibus undam, Nec varios inhiant pulchra testudine postis!

47. permutem, for construction see on 1. 17. 2 ‘ Lucretilem
mutat Lycaeo!

ODE Il

Α PICTURE of the old Roman character for the imitation of the
young. Compare with it Od. 4. 9. 34 to end. ⁴ Hardness, to be
learnt early in the school of actual warfare—courage—virtue, sels-
involved and independent of popular rewards——the power of silence?

1. amice pati. An extension of the more common ‘lente serre,’
‘clementer ferre,' Cic. ‘ Amice ’ is the reading of all the oldest
MSS. The words of Acr. ‘ Hanc oden ad amicos generaliter
scribit’ would not necessarily imply, as Bentley argues, that he
read ‘amici,’ but that he took ‘amice’ for a vocative, and as an
addresg not to a special friend, but to any that should read
the O e.

2. robustus, predicative, so that it = ‘ita ut robustus fiat,’ and
the epithets ‘ robustus,' ‘ acri ’ answer to one another in Horace’s
manner. ‘A boy should learn to bear and welcorne the restraints
of poverty, and grow hardy in the sharp school of warfare.'

4. vexet, 4. 14. 23 ‘impiger hostium vexare turmas.’

6. hosticis, for the form see on 2. 1. 1 ‘civicum.’ For the
picture of* the wife and daughter looking from the wall on the
combat cp. Hom. Il. 3. 154 foll„ 22. 462 foll„ Virg. Aen. 11. 475.

8. adulta, sc. ‘nubilis.’

9. eheu, her sigh as she breathes the prayer ‘ ne‚' &c.

10. sponsus regius, ‘ accipiendum de alius regis foederati filio,
ut Coroebus (Virg. Aen. 2. 341) propter Cassandram Troiam
venerat‚' Orelli.

asperum tactu, ‘ dangerous to rouse‚' ‘ aspera tigris,' 1. 23. 9.

1 1. eruenta, that makes its way in blood.

13. Tyrt. 7. 1 Τεθνάμεναι ’γὰρ καλὸν ἐνὶ προμάχοισι πεσόντα Ι ἄνδρ’
ἀγαθὸν περὶ ᾔ πατρίδι μαρνάμενον.

14. more, taking up the last word ‘ mori.’ Deatlz the coward
