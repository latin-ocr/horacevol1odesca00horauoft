ΟΝ ΤΗΕ UNKNOWN NAMES IN THE ODES

A DISCUSSION of the unknown names in Horace’s Odes has no
such scope or purpose as it would have had in the last century.
No one would now dream of renewing the attempts, the futility of
which Buttmann and Estre exposed, to construet out of the Pyrrhas,
Lalages, and Lydias a history of the poet's loves and disappoint-
ments. Such attempts involved misconceptions both of the nature
of his lyrical genius and of the chronological relation of the Odes
to his life. They are not, like the lyrics of Catullus, the outpouring
of the stress and passion of youth, but the conscious and elaborate
work of one ‘cuius octavum trepidavit aetas Claudere lustrum.¹
Even with a lyrical poet of this type it may be true that each poem
had an occasion, that it may touch real life at some point, but the
occasion is often the slightest. The poet versifies not his own
experience only, but that of others3 a remark at a supper-party,
an incident related to him, a casual image in conversation, are
enough to set his fancy working, and the result is a dramatic
sketch of the situation or feeling suggested. In any case the Odes
are treated by their author as artistic studies: he arranges them
not in any order of time, but where they will be most useful to
relieve more serious poems or to stand as companion pictures.

In spite of this it may be worth while to point out some obvious
facts about the names that figure in the Odes. It will illustrate
a feature in Horace’s art, and may throw some light by analogy on
the employment of names in his other poems. Of the practice
recognized in Latin poetry of concealing the names of real persons
under Greek names of equivalent metrical value (as Virgil’s Lycoris
for Cytheris, Catullus’ Lesbia for Clodia, Sec.) there is little trace to
be discovered in the Odes. The Scholiasts, usually so quick-
sighted for such points, are silent except in the case of Licymnia in
Od. 2. 12, which does not concern, Horace himself. On the other
hand, many of the names are manifestly adapted by their etymo—
logical meaning to the ideal personages depicted, as Pyrrha in 1. 5,
Chloe in 1. 23, Lyce in 3. 10, Phidyle in 3. 23: cp. Sybaris in 1. 8;
the list may possibly be extended by the names of Lalage in 1. 22,
Leuconoe in 1. 11, and of Telephus 1. 13, διε. (Horace is fond of
playing on the meaning of names, ‘Glycerae immitis,’ 1. 33. 2,
⁶ Bibuli consulis amphoram,’ 3. 28, 8.) Some more are adapted to
the metre ot the special poem ; as Leuconoe in 1. 11, ⁴ Asterie ' in
3. 7, and ‘ Neobule ' [cp. the name of her lover, ‘ Liparaeus Hebrus')
