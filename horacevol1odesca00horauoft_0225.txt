BOOK I, ODE XIV, 1—17

⁷ harbour first,’ i. e. before the fresh waves prevent you. The ship is
¹4 still outside the bar.

‘ 4. nudum, supply ⁴ sit,’ as also aster ‘ saucius.’ Orelli speaks of
ς· this as ‘ miro zeugmate ex v. “gemant ” ν. “sit ’⁵ elicere‚’ and thinks
’ξ it far more poetical to make ‘ gemant ’ the verb to all three clauseS.
⁷ But it is a harsher zeugma to speak of a broadside swept bare of
·, rowers as ‘ groaning ' in the same sense as yardarms. And if
ξ ‘gemant’ apply to all three subjects‚ the ‘ antennae ’ are left with-
” out any special description of the injury done to them. For ‘ vides
,. ut . . . gemant,’ the particular sense of ‘seeing' being lost after
⁷3? a time in the more general notion of ‘ perceiving‚’ cp. Od. 3. 10. 5-8
F ‘ Audis quo strepitu ianua . . . remugiat Ventis, et positas ut glaciet
nives Iuppiter,’ and Virg. Aen. 4. 490 ‘ mugire videbis Sub pedibus
„ terram et descendere montibus ornos.’

7 6. sine funibus. They are the ὑποζώματα of Plat. Rep. p. 616 C ;
⁷ cp. Acts xxvii. 17 βοηθείαις ἐχρῶντο, ὑποζωννύντες τὸ πλοῖον, ropeS
passed round the hull to prevent the timbers starting.

7. durare, Virg. Aen. 8. 577 ‘ durare laborem!

carinae, apparently a plural for a sing, the keel and all that
belongs to it, the timbers that start from it, the hull, the bottom.
² Bentley takes it as a proper plural, ‘ Other ships about you.’
⁴ 8. imperiosius, ‘ too tyrannous‚’ ‘ peremptory.’ The sea insists
ζ on breaking in, will have no refusal.

10. non di, sc. ‘ sunt integri.' The images of gods which were
carried on board as a protection to the ship ; Pers. 6. 30 ‘ Iacet ipse
in litore, et una Ingentes de puppe dei!

11. Pontica, cp. Catullus, ‘ Dedicatio Phaseli‚' 4. 13 ‘Amastri

Pontica, et Cytore buxifer‚’ &o
' 12. nobilis, with ‘silvae‚’ ‘a forest of name,' cp. Od. 3. 13. 13
‘ fies nobilium tu quoque fontium.'

14. pictis puppibus, Virg. Aen. 5. 663. Ships in Homer are
μιλτοπάρῃοι, Seneca, perhaps thinking of this place, Ep. 76 ‘ navis
bona dicitur non quae pretiosis coloribus picta est, . . . sed stabilis
et firma et iuncturis aquarn excludentibus spissa.’

timidus, ‘in the time of his fear.'

, 15, 16. nisi debes . . . eave, ‘ unless thou art doomed to make

sport for the winds, take good heed,' i. e. if it is any use to warn
you, be warned. ⁴ Cave,’ absolutely, as in Epod. 6. 11 ‘cave . . .
ν cave.' ‘ Debere’ is ‘to be bound to give' ; it may be, because we
,. have received an equivalent; it may be, as here, by some irrever-
sible law outside of us, as we talk of death as the ‘ debt' of nature:
‘ debemur morti nos nostraque,’ A. P. 62. The position of ‘ cave '
gives it the necessary emphasis. v

17, 18. Here Horace seems to be thinking of the Commonwealth
- as much as of the ship. The contrast is between the two moments‚
a few hours ago when the ship was struggling for existence in the
stom, and now when it is at the haven's mouth, but still not quite
safe. His feeling towards it then was ‘ a hopeless beart-sickening,’
now it is ‘ a fond yearning and anxious care.'
