THE ODES OF HORACE

Accipio! It was a Greek licence; cp amongst others Soph. Ο. T ·

733 σχιστὴ δ’ ὁδὸςΙ l ἐς ταύτὸ Δελφῶν κάπὸ Δαυλίας” αγει.

3. velox mente nova. The inspiration so alters him that he
can hardly recognize his soul as his own, and it endows him with
the swiftness of thought.

quibus antris, local ablative.

4-6. The constr. is ‘ audiar, meditans inserere! Horace already

‘meditatur inserere,’ ἃς. The question is where his dreamings
will find voice and an auditory.

4. egregii, 1.6. 11.

5. aeternum is predicative, ‘ to set Caesar' s glory as a new star
in the skies for ever?

meditans = μελετῶν, ‘planning,' ‘practising’ Possibly also it
suggested the idea, which it often conveys, of poetical composition

as the means of conferring the promised glory. · ‘meditari ’ is used .

in the sense of‘ composing aloud’ in Virg. E. 6. 82 ‘ Omnia, quae
Phoebo quondam meditante beatus Audiit Eurotas?

6. oonsilio Iovis, ‘the council- board of Jupiter? Virgil’ 5 ‘quem
mox quae sint habitura deorum Conciliaj G. 1. 24, is hardly as
high a compliment to Augustus’ wisdom. The general ternis
in which Caesar’ 5 apotheosis is spoken of are the same in the two
passages. In both he is at one moment to be a god, at another
a star.

7. The subject of his song is to be something notable, some-
thing new, something which no tongue has sung of before him.

reeens implies that the events are fresh.

8. non secus, &c. As the Bacchante who has been carried by
her frenzy to the top of Haemus (cp. Lucan. 1. 673 ‘vertice Pindi
Edonis Ogygio decurrit plena Lyaeo ⁹) gazes in rapt astonishment
on the plain of Thrace before her, the Hebrus watering the middle
of it, Rhodope its western boundary—so the poet, carried he knows
not where (ι devio ⁹), looks with delighted wonder on river-banks
and woodland. The two points of comparison are the unexpected-
ness of the sight, and its effect in rousing further the Bacchic or
the poetic ἐνθουσιασμός. Thrace is sacred land to the Bacchante‚
the woods and streams to the poet, 3. 4. 5 foll.,“4.3. 10.

9. exeomn183 Soph. Ant. 1152 Θυίαισιν αἵ σε μαινόμεναι πάν-
νυχοι 1 χορεύουσι. The epithet indicates her excitement. Bentley,
objecting that the Bacchae are spoken of by Euripides (Bacch. 682)
and other poets as sleeping‚ and that‘ iugis’ requires an epithet,
needlessly alters ‘exsomnis’ to ‘Edonis,’ and he is followed by
Meineke‚ Haupt, and Dillr. Kiessling reads ‘exsomnis’ to be
taken closely with ‘ stupet,’ ‘ wakes to gaze astonished‚’ διο.

11. pede barbaro. The point of the epithets is the desolation ·

or savagery of the view 3 they correspond to the ‘ vacuum nemus‚’
cf. v. 13 : there is room there for the god and for the muses.
12. ut, constr. after ‘non secus’: cp. 1. 16. 7, 9 ‘aeque. u.t’
14. Naiadum potens, 1. 3. 1.
