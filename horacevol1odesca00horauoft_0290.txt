THE ODES OF HORACE

For the Scholiast’s‚ probably wrong, identification of him with Titius, ‘-
the Pindaric poet on Tiberius's staff, see on Epp. 1. 3. 9. '-
Some difficulty has always been felt as to the period in Horace’s j
life in which he could with any propriety describe himself as ‘ tired .··“
of travelling and campaigning’ (v. 7), and these words have been ξ
made a ground for placing the Ode at a date earlier than 31 B.c. ᾗ
(see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 2). Mr. A. Platt, in the Journal of ·:
Philology, No. 41, has made a suggestion which, on this and other ἰ
groundS‚ seems very worthy of consideration. It has always been ‘
assumed that the opening of the Ode is an imitation of Catullus 11-
1 foll.
‘ Furi et Aureli, comites Catulli, Ξ
sive in extremos penetrabit Indos, Ξ
litus ut longe resonante an ἒ
tunditur unda,’ ²

where it will be seen that the parallelisrn goes to the end of the {13
stanza. Mr. Platt points out that there are several difficulties in ξ
the way of this assumption. If it be true, it is the only instance in ὲ
the Odes in which Horace imitates Catullus, whom otherwise he
markedly ignores. On the other hand, the Ode of Catullus, if i
naturally interpreted, has an ironical and sarcastic tone which is i
absent from Horace. He suggests as the solution that both Catullus ᾗ
and Horace are independently adapting to their own purposes 3
a Greek original—probably a Sapphic Ode of Alcaeus. This is his s·
explanation of ‘ Sit modus lass& διο. It is only playfully applied
to Horace. It was not he but Alcaeus who sang and suffered
‘ dura navis, dura fugae mala, dura belli! ’

1—3. Gadis . . . Cantabrum . . . Syrtis. Dillr. points out that
the three places named represent distance (‘ remotis Gadibus,’ 2. 2.
10) and danger, either of war or shipwreck. We may notice, per-
haps, that they correspond also, though not in the same order, to
the three things of which the poet professes to have had enough,
‘ maris, viarum, militiae.’ >

3. barbaras Syrtis. The coast is given a bad name not only
for its dangers (see on Od. 1. 22. 6, where there is the same con-
junction), but for the savageness of its inhabitants. Virg. Aen. 4.
41 ‘inhospita Syrtis?

5. Argeo, Ἀργείῳ, as ‘ Lesbous ’ instead of the Latin form ’ς’
‘ Lesbius‚’ Od. 1. 1. 34. For the historical reference see on Od. 1. Ξ

·“?2·r?·*-m⁴··‘⁴'“” *mm :virve

7. Ι . ,
7.3 maris et. viarum, Epp. 1. 11. 6 ‘ odio maris atque viarum ’ 3 ν
so ‘ viator ’ is opposed to ‘ navita,’ Od. 3. 4. 32. The genitive seems ἴ
to go both with ‘lasso ' (as Virg. Aen. 1. 178 ‘fessi rerum ’) and
with ‘ modus,' see on Od. 1. 3. 6.

10. pellitis, Varro de R. R. 2. 2 explains this epithet. ‘ovibus
pellitis, quae propter lanae bonitatem ut sunt Tarentinae et Attlcae ⁷
pellibus integuntur, ne lana inquinetur.'
