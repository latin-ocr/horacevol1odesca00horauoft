the Calabrian bays, or the hollow of the waves themselves. For
this last, cp. Virg. G. 4. 361 ‘Curvata in montis faciem circum-

ODE XXXIV

‘ I SURRENDER my old Epicurean doctrine of the “careless” gods

J (Sat. ·1. 5. 101). I have heard thunder not where Lucretius might

⁷- explain it to me from clashing clouds, but in a cloudless sky, where

{¹ I could not but recognize it as the rolling of the chariot wheels that

shake all creation. It is the same hand that launches “bolts from

J a clear sky ’⁹ in human thingS‚ that lifts the humble and overthrows
the proud when men least expect it!

δ · Horace is thinking of the challenge with which Lucretius clenches
hls argument that thunder comes from purely natural causes :—

‘Denique ‘cur numquam caelo iacit undique puro
Iuppiter m terras fulmen sonitusque profundit?'—6. 400.

The notable changes of fortune in his mind at the time are very
possibly the vicissitudes of Phraates and Tiridates on the Parthian
throne (see Introd. to Odes i-iii‚ ξ 8), though the expressions in
vy. 14 foll. are not particular enough to necessitate this interpreta-
tion. The framework of the Ode bears some resemblance to that
