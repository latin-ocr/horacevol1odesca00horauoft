of Rome and of the Emperor.

· An argument, second only in weight to this, is founded upon the

Odes (2. 10 and 3. 19) which have reference to Licinius Murena,
the brother of Terentia, Maecenas’ wife (see also on Od. 2. 2. 5).
Murena was executed for participation with Fannius Caepio in
a conspiracy against Augustus in B.C. 22. The presumption seems
very strong that even if Horace's feelings would have allowed him
to publish these poems, and especially od. 2. 10, after his friend’s
catastrophe, he would have been deterred by the knowledge that

'f the reminiscences must be displeasing to Maecenas as well as to
ζ’ Augustus. Franke recalls the story of Virgil’s striking out the

 

 

praises of Gallus from the end of Georg. iv on somewhat similar

v ounds.
γ nghe arguments for postponing the publication of the Odes to

a later date are not such as can really be set against these con-
siderations. They turn mainly on Od. 1. 3, which is taken to refer
to the voyage of Virgil to Athens in the last year of his life, Β. c. 19:

5 and on the supposed allusions (the strongest case is Od. 2. 9) to
2 the expedition of Tiberius into Armenia, and the restoration of the

standards by the Parthians in B.C. 20. Some remarks on these

, points will be found in the Introductions to Od. 1. 3 and 2. 9.

There remains the possibility that these (and if these, then other)

·. Odes may have been inserted after the first publication. It will be
ζ seen that this is not likely to have been the case with 1. 3 3 and the
theory of any such insertions is perhaps hardly compatible with that

pause in lyric composition between the publication of Books i—iii

ἱ and the commencement of Book iv, which is implied in Suetonius'
2 statement, and in Horace's own words, Od. 4. 1. 1, Epp. 1. 1. 1—10.

§ 3. When we pass from the general epoch to the date qf special
Odes we are on less safe ground. A very few can be fixed with
exactness. Such are 1. 31, which is written for the dedication of

. the temple of Apollo Palatinus in B.C. 28; 2. 4, which Horace
. dates himself in B.C. 25, by reference to his own age; 1. 24 and
ξ’ 3. 14, both of which are fixed to B.C. 24, the one by the known date

ξ of the death of Quintilius, the other by the return of Augustus from
3 Spain. We may perhaps add a few, though in their case of course
