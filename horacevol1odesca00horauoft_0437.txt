BOOK IV, oDE vm, 6-22

of the elder Scipio, and five years after the death of his friend the
poet Ennius, who in his Annales wrote a poetical account of the
Second Punic War. We cannot accuse Horace of confusing the
two Scipios‚ and (as Bentley points out) the critical contemporaries
who heard and read his poems of tolerating the confusion. Nor
are the conjectural emendations ‘impendia’ (Cunningham), ‘sti-
pendia' (Doring), ‘ In dispendia' (Hermann), likely or happy. The
line is condemned by Bentley as a monkish interpolation, on metrical
as well as historical grounds, and it is the first and most obvious
victim of those who wish to reduce the Ode to conformity with
Meineke’s canon; see Index of Metres‚ § 6. It remains to interpret
the lines as they stand, and the difficulties do not seem to be as
great as they have been represented. If we wish (with Ritter) to
make Africanus Major the subject of the whole comparison, then
the burning of Carthage will be adduced‚ not as his act, but as the
crown and completion, by one of his name, of his victories, as some-
thing which might be supposed to revive and keep alive his same.
‘ Not marble monuments, not his great feats of arms, not the com-
pletest posthumous success of his policy and hereditary transmission
of his fame, win for him the glory that Ennius' poetry wins for him.’
The truth, however, is perhaps that Horace is (not confusing, but)
consciously uniting the two Scipios. ‘What throws most glory on
the name of Africanus? Zama and the destruction of Carthage, or
Ennius' poetry ? ' ‘ Eius qui . . . rediit,' is merely a periphrasis for
the name ‘ Africanus,' and Horace could have used it apparently of
the younger Scipio, as he uses of him in Sat. 2. 1. 65 the periphrasis
‘qui Duxit ab oppressa meritum Carthagine nomen.' Cp. the
words which Cicero puts into the mouth of Scipio Africanus Major
as addressed to his grandson, ‘ Hanc [Carthaginem] evertes, eritque
cognomen id tibi per te partum quod habes adhuc a nobis here-
ditarium,’ Somn. Scip. 1 1. In favour of this view is the fact already
pointed out, that the sentiment is really general, ‘famous deeds¹
are specialized, after Horace's manner, into ‘the deeds of the two
Scipios,’ and poetry is specialized into the poetry of (or such as
that of) Ennius3 but we may rernember that Scipio’s exploits were
only the last in the long series of glories which formed the subject
of Ennius’ poem. That it stopped short of Africanus Minor is a
fact that Horace might ignore.

15. fugae . . . minae. The flight of Hannibal from Italy, and
the return on his own head, by Scipio’s invasion of Africa, of the
threats he had offered to Rome by his invasion of Italy.
