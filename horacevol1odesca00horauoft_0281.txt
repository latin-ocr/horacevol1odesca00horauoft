BOOK II, ODE Ι, 30-ODE II, 5-8

possessed copper mines in the Tarentaise (‘ Ceutronum tractu ²),
and it has been suggested that this gave a special point to the first
stanza, ‘As you know from your experience of ore.' The true
person of the Ode, however, is Proculeius, the example of the right
use of wealth-—and he (see note on vv. 5-8) was the brother-in-law
of Maecenas and the friend of the Emperor-so that the Ode
becomes a compliment to them.

1-4. ‘As silver has no brightness while it is still in the mine,
so wealth only acquires its value by the uses it is put to.’ In
the first line and a half we have the allegory, its application helped
by the epithet ‘avaris,’ which suggests the miser's hoards as the
parallel for the useless ore; in the remainder of the stanza we have
the application, but still clothed‚ with the exception of ‘ temperat0‚’
in terms metaphorical‚ taken from the allegory (⁴1amnae‚' ‘splen-
deat’). See notes on 1. 35. 19, 4. 2. 5—8, 4. 4. 59.

2. abdito terris, as Od. 3. 3. 49 ‘aurum irrepertum . . . cum terra
celat! Much of the force of the stanza is lost if we take it with the
Scholiast of the miser’s treasure, ‘qui defosso incubat auro,’ Sat.
1. 1. 41.

lamnae, the unwrought bar into which the ore was first run.
Bentley pointed out that the construction is ‘inimice lamnae nisi
splendeat,’ not as it had been strangely taken, ‘nullus argento
colog {st nisi splendeat.’ For the syncopated form see on Od.

ξ. crispe Sallusti. For this inversion of the family and the
gentile name cp. ‘ Hirpine Quinti,' Od. 2. 11. 23 ‘ Fuscus Aristius,'
Sat. 1. 9. 61. In A. P. 371 there is an inversion of ‘nomen' and
‘praenomen,’ ‘ Cascellius Aulus.’ Such change of order, where the
full names are not formally given, is found in Cicero occasionally‚
chiefly in the Letters, but see de Senect. 14. 48 ‘Turpione Ambivio!
It becomes common in the later writers.

4. usu seems to apply primarily to the brightening of genuine
metal by handling (λάμπει γὰρ ἐν χρείαισιν ὥσπερ ἐκπρεπὴς χάλκος,
Soph. Fr. 742, quoted by Ritter) ; secondarily and metaphorically‚
to the right use of money. In the epithet ‘ temperato,' on the con-
trary, the moral sense is the predominant one.

5-8. An instance of the wisely directed use of which he speaks.
Acron's note is, ‘ Proculeius qui pius sic erga fratres suos Scipionem
et Murenam fuit ut cum spoliatis bello civili patrimonium suum de
integro divideret,’ in which ‘ Scipionem' has been ingeniously
altered by Estre to ‘Caepionem,' the name of the person who
suffered with Murena for a conspiracy against Augustus in Β. C. 22.
There is no reason, however, from any other authority, to suppose
that the two were brothers. It may perhaps be doubted whether
Horace’s words necessarily imply that Proculeius had more than
'one brother: the plural generalizes. That he was the brother (or
cousin, for this doubt always besets the words ‘ frater' and ἀδελφός)
of Murena (Od. 3. 19. 11, Sat. 1. 5. 38), the ‘ Licinius ' of Od. 2. 10,
