THE EPODES OF HORACE

more personal than before. It is no longer Varus or some unnamed
victim of her spells, but Horace (see esp. v. 58), and it gives an
interpretation to the other two poenis. If they had stood alone we ,
might have thought that it was a class, or a public folly, that he ’
was assailing. But here we can hardly doubt that we have a

persona] enmity‚ involving more or less of real bitterness, and ζ
expressed under a form more or less allegorical. It is impossible {s

to read the riddle completely. Horace doubtless dramatizes

imaginary situations, but it is not in his way to sustain an imaginary 'j
character through three entire poems,.besides making it the object ⁴
of allusions in several others. Cp. Epod. 3. 8, Sat. 2. 1. 48, 2. 8. ·

95, and see Introd. to Od. 1. 16. This Epode is posterior to Epod.

5 and Sat. 1. 8, for it contains references to them 3 see vv. 47-52, 58. ;

Ι. do manus, ‘yield’3 Cic. ad Att. 2. 22 ‘Aiebat illum primo

sane diu multa contra, ad extremum autem manus dedisse.’ v

2. Proserpinae. . .Dianae; Epod. 5. 51. They are the powers ,
of night and the lower world, to whom witches might be supposed

to ξῖῗιξη movenda, ‘that may not be provoked’3 Od. 3. 20. 1

‘ Non vides quanto moveas periclo, Pyrrhe, Gaetulae catulos ι’

ξῗὲῃὲἓιῗῑηὶῑωω, of magic formulae; Epod. 5. 72, &c.‚ Virg. E.
. 7—72.

5. refixa, pred., ‘to draw the stars from the skies and bring =

thern down'3 Virg. Aen. 5. 527 ‘ caelo ceu saepe refixa Trans-

 

currunt . . . sidera.⁹ Conington remarks that the stars are viewed

as nails that stud the sky. .
63bvoeibue eaor-ie, ‘ mystic words’3 Epod. 5. 76 ‘ Marsis Ξ
vogl ἓέἰτο solve, ‘let it loose‚ that it may run back.'

turbinem, ῥόμβον, the wheel, which was one of the instruments
of a magician. Theocritus gives a meaning to its spinning 2. 30

Ὠς δινεῖθ’ ὅδε ῥόμβος ὁ χάλκεος ἐξ Ἀφροδίτας, Ι ὣς τῆνος δινοῖτο ποθ’
ἁμετέρῃσι θύρῃσιν.

8. movit, ‘moved to pity.’

nepotem Nasium, as the son of Thetis. Telephus had been
wounded by Achilles, and the oracle declared that he only who
had wounded him could cure him.

11. unxere3 Virg. Aen. 6. 219, of the honours paid to the body »

of Misenus, ‘corpusque lavant frigentis et unguunt.' Some good
MSS. have ‘luxere’3 but ‘ unxere ⁷ answers better to ‘addictum
alitibus’: it expresses more definitely the fact which is the real

point, viz. that they recovered the body, though Achilles had

declared that they should not have it. ‘ Luxere’ would at least

involve an ambiguity‚ even if it admits, as Bentley argues, the ᾗ

sense of formal mourning over the body.
