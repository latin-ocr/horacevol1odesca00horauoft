inspiration with his own humble aims and laborious imitative
method, ‘ gathering honey from flower to flower of Greek 1 yrics,
and enshrining it in the‘ ‘curiosa felicitas'’ of his own poetical
sty-le'3 in v. 30, ‘circa nemus . ,Tiburis‚’ we get a slightly
different idea,‘ from wood to wood of his Sabine neighbourhood!
The simile was introduced to express the difference in genius and
literary habits between Pindar and Horace, but it suggests to the
poet his own wanderings in the valley of the Anio. The Matine

but a ‘ spring’ will be specially germane to a ‘ swan.’

26. Antoni. As Orelli points out, the name is re eated to mark
the summing up and the practical conclusion. ‘ ou know, An-
tonius, the difference between Pindar’s powers and mine. You

² ⁴ will treat this high theme yourself better than I can.’

2.17.30,3.17. 5. The‘ ego. .parvus’ of the last stanzas con-
trasts not only with Pindar before, but with Antonius‚‘ maiore
plectro,' who follows. We may note, a130, that part of the contrast
lies in the occasion. ‘Not now, neither you nor Ι. By and by,
whenever it is that Caesar comes home in triumph, a greater poet
than I shall sing his praises, and even I (v. 45) shall find a voice
in my delight.’ ‘Maiore plectro’ occupies a double relation, as
instrumental ablative with ‘ concines,’ and descriptive ablative with
‘poeta’; see on 1. 3. 6. With the expression itself cp. ‘leviore
plectro,’ 2. 1. 40, ‘aureo plectro,’2. 1326.

was given to the slope by which the ‘ Sacra via 'descended, from
the spot where its pavement is still visible under the Arch of Titus,
into the Forum, a fall of 53 feet.
