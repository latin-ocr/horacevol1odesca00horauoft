THE EPODES OF HORACE

 

logical form of such poems as Od. 1. 2. Compare in this respect, ,’
as in others, Epod. 16, which belongs to the same period.

5- -.8 ‘ Not as our fathers shed their blood for foreign conquest, ’τ
nor as we might shed ours to complete their conquestsl ..

7. intactus = ‘integerss Od. 4. 4. 66,‘ non ante devictus.' The ·
conquefst of Britain is to Horace even in the Odes a triumph still ν ἶ
m the uture. .

descenderet, to be explained in connexion with the expression ῃ

‘sacer clivus' in Od. 4. 2. 35, see note there. The triumphal pro-

cession descended by the ‘Sacra via’ into the Forum, through ''
which it passed to the foot of the Capitoline hill. Before t'he ascent ,
of that began the captives were led aside from the ranks. Cp. Cic.
Verr. 5. 39. 77‘ Cum de foro m Capitolium currum flectere incipiunt
illos duci in carcerem iubent3 idemque dies et victoribus imperi et ·
victis vitae finem facit)

9. sua dextera, Epod. 16. 2 ‘ Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit.'

11, 12. feris serves to explain ‘hic mos,' as though it were ‘ut 4³
feri essent,' so that it shares 1n the general negation and exception, ,³ss
‘ this was never the wont of wolves or lions to turn their rage save {2
on some other kind.' There ι5 no need with Bentley to read‘ num·
quam. ’ ‘Dispar' is used by Cic. Tusc. 5.13. 38 for animals of
a different species. Bentley compares, for the sentiment, Juv. 15.
159 foll„ Plin. N. H. 7. 1 ‘leonum feritas inter se non dimicat?
Sen. Epp. 95 ‘cum inter se mutis ac feris pax sit,' and notices the ·’
growth of humanity and logie in the interval· ‚ ‘quo Horatius ἶ
argumento utitur ne Romanus contra Romanum eodem illi φιλο- ³
σοφώτερον utuntur ne homo contra hominem bella gerat.’ Ῑ

15. tacent. He turns from the tongue-tied prisoners to the
court before which he is arraigning them.

17. sio est. He gives the explanation which most exonerates
his countrymen. ‘ It is the power of ἄτη, an interminable inheri-
tance of unavoidable crime, dating from the first founder of the
state.’

’ fata scelusque, not two things, but one. ,

19. ut, ‘ever since,’ see on Od. 4. 4. 42. For the thought cp. -J
Lucan. 1. 95 ‘ Fraterno primi maduerunt sanguine muri.'

20. sacer, ‘ ut piaculum luendus‚' Orelli.

EPODE IX

‘WHEN shall we have our feast, Maecenas, in your great house ’
at home, to celebrate Caesar's victory as we celebrated the defeat
of Sextus Pompeius a little while ago? Oh, the shame to think of
Roman soldiers in Cleopatra's effeminate camp! Even Galatian
horsemen deserted her, and her fleet would not fight. Why is not
the triumphal procession already moving—the triumph of a captain
