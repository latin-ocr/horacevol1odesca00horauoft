GENERAL INTRODUCTION

words upon two subjects which present themselves very early to the
reader of any notes upon Horace.

C onjectural Emendation.

The first has been glanced at already. 1 do not know that
conjectural emendation has really been exceptionally busy upon
Horace’s text. That the two are specially associated in the minds of
general readers is due doubtless, in a great measure, to their greater
familiarity with the author, to the brilliancy of the conjectures them-
selves, the contributions of a long series of the greatest scholars
from the Renaissance onwards, particularly perhaps to the un-
rivalled power, learning, and eloquence with which our greatest
English scholar recommended the method and its results in
his edition of the poet. There was something, however, in the
nature of the critical evidence on which Horace’s text rests which
made conjectural emendation, if not specially necessary, at least
specially tempting. Necessary of course it was not, in the sense in
which it is necessary in the text of Aeschylus or of Lucretius, to
restore sense or metre in a chaos3 but in a way the multiplicity of
MSS. tempts us to do for one author what the poverty of MSS.
almost compels us to do for another. A variety of readings, all con-
sistent with metre and intelligible, and all resting on fairly equal MS.
testimony, must imply the hand of one or more emenders of the
text at an early period. It is a natural interpretation to assume in
such a case that all alike are attempts, more or less skilful, to fill
up a gap in the original authority; and this once believed, a
scholar of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries may not unreason-
ably think himself as competent to guess the riddle as a scholar
of the fourth or fifth. It is manifest that no impassable barrier
separates cases where the MSS. are divided from those where they
are consentient. Division is only a sign of the disease. We have
already seen that it is confessedly possible for the same blunder to
infest every MS. A modern editor will probably set aside, as
a ru1e, purely conjectural emendations; at any rate, he will hesitate
to give them the reality which is implied by printing them in the
text3 not because he denies the possibility of corruptions, or does
not feel the plausibility of many conjectures, but only because
experience has taught us that there is no necessary limit even to
