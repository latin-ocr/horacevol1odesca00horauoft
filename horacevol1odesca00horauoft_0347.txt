Horace almost seems to forget that he has localized the majesty
of heaven in Jupiter. His object now is to exalt Pallas, the repre-
sentative of mind. The power of heaven might be cowed, but the
mind was unshaken.

Horace intends, by the collocation of ‘ horrida,' to give the force of

there is definite reference to a completed action. The object in
view was not only to place Pelion on Olympus, but to leave it
standing there. This reference is clear in the old use of the perf.
inf. after ‘volo’ in prohibitions (‘ ne quis habuisse velit,’ Senatus·
consultum de Bacchanalibus. So Horace, ‘ Ne quis humasse velit,’
S. 2. 3. 1873 it is analogous to the perf. conj. in direct prohibition.
This, and not any aoristic use, seems to be the explanation of ‘ne

Virgil had inverted. But in so doing he has left the epithet with
what, in his arrangement, is the least appropriate substantive. In
Homer and Virgil, the ‘nodding woods’ on the top add to the
