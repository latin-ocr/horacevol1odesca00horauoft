LIBER TERTIUS

ODE I

‘ HEAR the teaching of the Muses, ye that are fit to receive it.
All human greatness is bounded. Kings are above us, but Jove is
above kings3 men may differ in wealth and rank, but Death makes
no distinction. To one who has the sword of Damocles above his
head no feasts will taste sweet‚ no music bring sleep ς yet sleep may
be had in peasants’ cots or on a shady river bank. Moderate your
desires. It is not the desire for what life needs that puts the
trader’s happiness at the mercy of a stormy sea, or the sarmer's at
the mercy of the weather. The rich proprietor, weary of the same-
ness of the dry land, builds houses out into the sea; but sear and
conscience and care are not to be escaped; marbles and purple
and costly wines can't take away a pang. Don't ask me, then, to
change my happy Sabine valley for a palace that will only bring on
me envy, and wealth that only increases trouble.'

The exordium suits the beginning of a Book, and also indicates
that the Ode or Odes which follow have some special dignity. The
sequence of six Odes in the same metre, and dealing with the same
general subject, is by itself sufficiently different from the poet’s
usual practice to attract remark. Diomedes, in his account of
Horace’s metres, treats them as one continuous poem, numbering
Ode 7 as 23 and both MSS. and Scholiasts are inclined to preSS,
beyond the bounds of probability, the connexion between one Ode
and another (see Introd. to Ode 3, and note on 4. 1). The unity‚ ,
however, of general purpose is obvious. The ends social, moral, ὲ
religious, political, which a good government would set before itself “
in Rome are reviewed, and it is more than once promised that
Caesar’s regime is to compass them.

This need not, however, imply that the Odes were all composed
at the same time, and consciously as a series. The invocation of
the Muse at the beginning of the fourth is more natural in an
independent Ode. The sixth seems to be earlier than the rest.
The references of vv. 13-16 are more easily explained if the ‘bellum
Actiacum’ was still recent, and the tone is more pessimistic than
that of the other five. It dwells on the evils without foreseeing the
remedy as they do. On the other hand, the indications of date in
the fourth (vv. 33-38) lead us rather to Augustus' campaign in Spain
B. c, 25.

listen to me, maidens and boys.' This idea is partly clothed in the
