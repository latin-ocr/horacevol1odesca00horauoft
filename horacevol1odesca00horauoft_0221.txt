l 45. ‘As a tree grows by the unmarked lapse of time, so grows

ἒ the glory of Marcellus’ 3 so the glory of the house, dating at least
from the captor of Syracuse (B. C. 212), is now culminating in the

ἓ 47. Iulium eidusf the star of Julius' is t'he same as ‘Caesaris
astrum,⁹ Virg. E. 9. 47, the comet which appeared after Julius
Caesar's death. Here it stands for the name and greatness of the

seeundo Caesare, ‘ with Caesar for thy second! Some editors,
as Kiessling‚ see a definite reference to v. 18 in which Horace had
denied that there could be a ‘second' to Jupiter. The flattery

, would be gross for Horace, and if it were meant it would be more

-ἶ unmistakeably expressed. ,If not intended, however, the repetition

sovereignty, ‘Caesar on earth, Jove in heaven’ (cp. Od.3..5. 1),

⁷ but the two sovereignties are connected. The rule of Caesar 1s the
restoration of religion.
