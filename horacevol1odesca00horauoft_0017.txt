Later' MSS.

M. In the Convent Library at Molk Both of the eleventh century.

C and E, two parts (which they distinguish, C as of the eleventh,
E of the twelfth century) of a MS. (14685) at Munich.
g. A Gotha MS. (Β. 61) of the fifteenth century, of which the
special value is that it seems in part to owe its readings
to V.

T lte ‘ classes ’ qs Keller and Holder.

, § 6. It is obvious that great additional weight could be obtained
for the testimony of MSS. even as late as those in which Horace’s
poems have come down to us if they could be grouped in families
' or ‘recensionsss each such family by its common readings bearing
. witness to some archetype of greater antiquity than any copies
which we now possess.

This has been attempted on an elaborate scale by Keller and
Holder. A and a, λ and l, φ and ψ, D and τ, Β and C, have been
supposed to be severally related in this way, and the readings of

their imagined archetypes are indicated by Holder by the signs
’ A', λ’, F, D', B'. We are supposed to have thus —to the extent
that unisorm readings can be obtained—a certain number of con-
jecturally restored MSS. much older than any that are still extant.
These and the other solitary representatives of older MSS. are
· again grouped into three classes.
⁵ The first of these is distinguished as containing, with many faults
of carelessness, and 'with a certain number of grammatical cor-
rections (e. g. ‘videri,’ against the metre in Epod. 16. 14), little or
2 no proof of alteration on rhetorical or general grounds. In this
class are placed for different parts of Horace’s poems A, α, R, D, r,
Α Μ, γ, Ε, C.

· The second class is supposed to show the corrections of an early

and intelligent emender. That such διορθωταί existed in early times

is stated by the Pseudo-Acron on Ars Poet. 345. And the name of
⁴ one is found in the inscription which appears, in slightly different
