ODE VII

‘Do not weep‚ Asterie, for your absent Gyges. He will come
back to you with the spring and bring a wealth of Bithynian
merchandise. He will come back: he is only detained by the
winter in the harbour to which he was driven on his way home.
He lies awake at night thinking of you. It is all in vain that his
hostess Chloe tries every art to win him, sends emissaries to tell
him of her passion and to prove to him from mythology the folly of
constancy; he turns a deas ear to it all. Only mind you do as
well. Your neighbour Enipeus is a brave young gallant, but don’t
open your window if he comes to serenade you.’

As Orelli characterizes it, ‘ εῖδύλλιον mercatorum vitam amoresque
lyrice describens! The names are Greek, the life Roman. Ν otice
the effect of this Ode in relieving by its lightness and grace the
seriousness of the preceding six. Compare the position of Od.

1—8. The first stanza gives the reasons why she should not weep
for him: ‘ He will come back with the west winds of spring with
the merchandise for which he sailed, and he will come back true to
you.’ The second stanza justifies the first prophecy, ‘he is only
detained by the weather’ 3 and the second, ‘ even now he is pining
to be at home with you.’>

1. candidi, 1. 7. 15.

3. Thyna, Bithynian‚ 1. 35. 7, Epp. 1. 6. 33.

4. fide, an archaic contracted form of the genitive, as ‘ die‚’ Virg.
G. 1. 208. It appears for the dative in Sat. 1. 3. 95 ‘commissa
fide! There is, however, some little doubt as to the form here, the
best existing MSS. reading ‘fidei’ as a disyllable. Against this
must be set the fact that in Sat. 1. 3. 95 they are unanimous for

. ‘ fide?

5. Notis, the plur. of continuous south winds, so ‘Aquilonibus,’

ζ 3. 10. 4.

Oricum, an important haven on the coast of Epirus within the

ι’ shelter of the Acroceraunian headland, into which ships making
’ the passage from Greece to Italy might be driven by unfavourable

winds. The idea is that Gyges has tried to cross late in the sailing
season and has been driven into Oricus, where he must now wait
till the spring opens the sea again. Cp. 4. 5. 9—12.

6. insana, as ‘vesani Leonis‚’ 3. 29. 19, there as bringing heat,
here storms.

caprae, ‘ signum pluviale Capellae‚’ Ov. Fast. 5. 113, the
brightest star of Auriga, to which also the Haedi belong. It is
the mythical goat that suckled the infant Jupiter.

9. atqui, 1. 23. 9, 3. 5. 49, Epod. 5. 67. 1t is strongly adversa-
