ODE XXVIII

THE poet represents himself as about to celebrate the ‘ Neptu—
nalia' by a carouse, in company with Lyde a ‘psaltria’ Cp. 4. 11.
‘What can he do better on such a day?’ He bids her ‘bustle
about and bring out the old Caecuban; ‘their sobriety will nee-d

Nedreiffissrslsse of Latona and Diana; then both together of Venus
an o ig t.’

The Neptunalia were held on July 23. Festus mentions the
custom of celebrating the day by erecting booths of boughs called
‘ umbrae’ along the bank of the Tiber.

2. reconditum, put safely away in the inner bins: cp. ‘interiore
nota‚' 2. 3. 8. v

3. strenua, with ‘prome‚’ ‘be vigorous and bring’3 it'almost
begins the metaphor of the next verse, ‘ show vigorous generalship.’
The Caecuban is the artillery that must be brought to bear against
the strong entrenchments of their seriousneSS.

Caecubum3 on 1. 20. 9.

4. sapientiam 3. 21. 14.

5. inclinare meridiem, in prose, ‘sol meridie se inclinavit,'
Liv. 9. 32, ‘ the noon has passed its full.’

7. horreo, a ‘store’ generally, having lost its original meaning
of a store of grain3 1. 1. 9. Here it is=-—‘apotheca'; see on

. 21. 7.
3 8. cessantem, as though it were the fault of the wine that it .
came no quicker.

Bibuli. C. Calpurnius Bibulus, cos. with C. Julius Caesar,
B. c. 59. There is doubtless a play on his name.

9. nos cantabimus inv-icem. Either ‘nos’==‘ego,’ 3. 11. 51,
3. 27. 14, ‘invicem’ meaning ‘in my turn'; or, more likely, ‘We
will sing in turn (‘ carmine amoebaeo’) of N eptune,' &c.‚ the sen-
tence beginning as though ‘invicem’ would have been enough to
point out that ‘ Neptune and the N ereids ' were to be the subject of
one’s song, Latona and Diana of ‘the othe1²s‚ and then ‘tu recines ’
having been inserted to make the antithesis more clear. For the
division cp. 1. 21.

11. recines, of an answering song, as in 1. 12. 3 of an echo.
The correspondence of the songs is indicated by the metrical
correspondence of vv. 10 and 12.

13. quae. What is the antecedent? ‘eam,‘ sc. ‘recines’ or
