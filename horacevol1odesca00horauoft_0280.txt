THE ODES OF HORACE

30. sepulcris, the barrows that marked battlefields (ib. 493-497).

31. auditumque Medis. There seem to be two ideas conveyed;
one of the mighty crash of the empire in the West heard in the
extreme East, the other of the shame that barbarians should witness
the catastrophe of Rome. Cp. Od. 3. 5. 39.

34. Dauniae, ‘ Apulian ⁹ for ‘ Roman.’ See on Od. 1. 22. 14 and

{gb-940. Cp. 1. 6. 17 foll., 3. 3. 69, 3. 5. 55, Introd. to Books i-iii,
