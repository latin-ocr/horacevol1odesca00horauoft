THE ODES OF HORACE

equal hypallage in making ‘apices ’ the object of ‘ trementi.’ The
‘apex’ (see on 1. 34. 14) represents the state and power of an
eastern king.

21. laeta, 5x080a=7rp66vu05‚ and so, ‘WIth goodwill.’

22. nodum, sc. of clasped hands, or of the concord which they ·
express3 cp. ‘Gratia iuncta sororibus‚’ 3. 19. 16. Seneca, interpreting
the characteristics with which they appear in paintings, describes
the Graces‚ Benef. 1. 3 ‘manibus implexis?

23. vivaeae‘vigiles: 3. 8. 14.

producent, ‘te ⁹ an extension of the ordinary ‘ producere cenam,’
‘ comissationem.’

24. dum . . . fugat, ‘ whilst he is putting to rout‚' as though he
were all night striving to do so, and only victorious in the morning.
Cp. the tense in Virg. E. 9. 23 ‘ Tityre dum redeo, brevis est via,
pasce capellas.

ODE XXII

AN inscription (or a poetical dedication which would have served
for an inscription) for a pine-tree which overhangs the Sabine farm,
and which the poet dedicates to Diana, to be honoured by him
henceforth with the yearly sacrifice of a young boar.

1. montium custos; 1. 21. 5foll. With the enumeration of
Diana’s attributes cp. Catull. 34. 9 foll. ‘Montium domina . . . >
Silearumque virentium . . . Tu Lucina dolentibus Iuno dicta puer· ,
eris? > -
p 3. ter. The number three has constantly mystic and ritual
associations3 see, inter al„ Od. 1. 28. 36, Epp. 1. 1. 37. Here
it can hardly be entirely unconnected with the triple character of ,
the goddess, ‘ triformis’ ; Virg. Aen. 4. 511 ‘Tergeminarnque Heca·
ten, tria virginis ora Dianae.'

6. pe}⁰ exactos annos, as each year (since the last celebration)
is com eted.

7. nfedjtantim see on 3. 13. 4. The participle seems to imply
that his tusks are just growing to the fit size,——he is thinking of
using them, but has not yet done 50,—and so points his age.

8. donem, subjunctive of purpose; ‘quam donem' gives the ³
full meaning of ‘ tua esto.’

 

ODE XXIII

‘ PRAY duly at the new moons, Ο country housewife, and offer to
the Lares frankincense and corn and a porker, and your wines and
your crops and your flocks shall be kept safe. Costly sacrifices are μ
for the ‘⁶ pontifices.’' Put your garlands of rosemary and myrtle on ξ.
