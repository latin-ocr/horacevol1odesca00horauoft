THE ODES OF HORACE

ex Metello consule, from the consulship of Q. Caec. Metellus
Celer and L. Afranius, B.C. 60, the year of the league between
Pompey, CrassuS, and Caesar, often called the First Triumvirate.

civicum, an archaic and, with the exception of the phrase ‘ civica
corona‚’ almost exclusively poetical form of the more usual ‘ civilis.’
Cp. ‘hosticus ' for ‘ hostilis,' 3. 2. 6.

2. vitia, ‘crimes’

modos = ‘rationes,' its shifting phases,now on land, now on sea, διε. i

3. ludum Fortunae, Od. 3. 29. 50, 1. 2. 37.

gravis principum amicitias, cp. Lucan, 1. 84 ‘Tu causa malo· ’

rum, Facta tribus dominis communis Roma, nec umquam In turbam

missi feralia foedera regni. O male concordesl’ ἃς. It must not ’

be applied to the triumvirate of Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus,
of which Horace would not speak' m such terms.

5. nondum expiatis, Od. 1. 2. 29.

uncta, Epod. 5. 19.

cruoribus, plural of quantity, Od. 2. 14. 25, Virg. Aen. 4. 687.

6. aleae, of hazards which no prudence can foresee. Horace’ s

object is not to discourage Pollio, but to exalt the value of the ¹

difficult task which he is performing.

7. ignis. ,doloso‚ metaphorical‚ of any dangerous business.

Callim. 46. 2 πῦρ ὑπὸ τῇ σποδὶῃ, Prop. 1. 5. 5 ‘ignotos vestigia ferre
per ignis!

9. severae, ‘solemn‚' ‘stately.' Cp. Aristotle’s epithets of ⁴

Tragedy and its subjects‚ σπουδαῖος, σεμνός.
11. ordinaris,‘ set in order’ after the Greek συντάττειν, of com-

position. Cp. ἀνατάξασθαι, St. Luke i. 1. This is the Scholiast's ς·
interpretation, but before Bentley the other commentators took it
to mean, according to a common poetical figure, ‘tell of the settlement ’1.
of' the State. Orelli’ s objection to this seems to be forcible‚ that ‘.ss

it would imply Pollio’s approval of Augustus’ policy more distinctly
than Horace appears to intend.

12. Cecropio cothurno. For the abl. cp. v. 16 ‘Delmatico ᾗ,
triumph0‚’ and 2. 7. 16 ‘fretis aestuosis‚’ and see on 1. 6. 2 and ⁷

3. 5. 5. The relation 1s of the nature of those classed together as
the ‘ablative absolute’ ; i..e the adjective is predicative, and it

is not the substantive alone, but the substantive and adjective f
together which constitute the circumstance which justifies or limits ζ
the main statement. Pollio's occupation is a ‘ lofty calling,’ because

the ‘ buskin' which he wears is that of the Attic stage.

14. consulenti, absol. ‘in its counsels.' Like ‘maestis,’ it Ῑ·’;7
describes the time at which Pollio's services would be most needed. s

Pollio. There seems to be force in the reservation of Pollio’s
name for this place, when our interest has been roused for the
forthcoming history, ‘the history written‚' Horace would say, ‘not
by a bystander, but by the great orator, statesman‚ warrior.'
Compare a more evident instance of art in the collocation of a name,
in the conclusion of Od 1. 2.

euriae, ‘the senate! Cp. Od. 3. 5. 7.
