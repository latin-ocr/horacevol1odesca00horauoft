IN TRODUCTION TO THE

comments on Pollio’s forthcoming history the poet’s disgust at the
aimless bloodshed of the epoch which is closed, while 15, 16, 18, by
their arraignment of social evils, prepare the way for the positive
aspect of the imperial rule which is to be shown in B. iii. We
notice that it is in this Book, as in neutral ground, that Horace
finds place (Od. 7) for reminiscences of the part which he had him-
self taken and for his tribute to the lost cause. It is in Β. iii, after
an exordium which calls special attention as to something of higher
import than anything that has gone before, that he sets himself
(Odes 1—6, 24) to describe at length the work which the new
government is to do, and the solid grounds on which good citizens
should accept it, as promising a regime of moderatiori and culture,
the restoration of religion, of the military spirit, of simple living
and morality.

§ 14. As with the political Odes, so with the others, although
the chronological order of composition is in no sense the primary
principle of arrangement, and is at times demonstrably departed
srom‚ Horace seems to have designedly given to each of the three
Books a colour and characteristics of its own. The First contains
probably on the whole his earlier compositions. In it are found
most of his experiments in metre (4, 7, 8, 28), most of the Odes
which seem studies from the Greek (as 10, 15, 30), or which take
their starting—point (as 9, 14, 18) from some known passage of
Greek poetry, The Second is the Book given most largely to
personal friendship and autobiographical touches. In the Third
we find what on literary grounds we feel to be Horace's maturest
work—the Odes in which he attains, if not his most perfect finish,
his greatest freedom3 in which the influence of Pindar seems to be
supplanting that of the Lesbian poetS. It is'the Book in which his
metrical ear seems most exacting. We may notice that the three
Books are made to mark stages in the poet‘s literary sels-confi-
dence. We pass from the deprecatory and ironical tone of 1. 1,
through 2. 20 in which, although he applies to himself the epitaph
of Ennius, heis still thinking (as in Sat. 1. 6) of the taunts levelled
at his humble origin, and finding his consolation in the favour of
Maecenas, to the triumphal tone of 3. 30, in which he claims the
bay as his right, and associates himself with the eternity of Rome.
