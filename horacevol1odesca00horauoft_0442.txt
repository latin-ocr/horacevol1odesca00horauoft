THE oDES OF! HORACE

abstinens pecuniae, the Greek relative genitive for the Latin
ablative‚ as ‘sceleris purus,'1.22. 1.
39. consul non unius anni. Cp. 3. 2. 17fou. ‘Virtus repulsae

nescia sordidae Intaminatis fulget honoribus, Nec sumit aut ponit
securis Arbitrio popularis aurae’ see note there. It is, in a τί·
Roman metaphor, the Stoic paradox that the wise man is always ’-
a king, and it has the more point that Lollius had actually been '

consul ;—‘ not that one year only, but always! There is no diffi-

culty, so far, in the substantives, ‘vindex,’ ‘ consul,' as applied to -.

‘ animus,' and not to the man himself ; no more than in the passage

just quoted, where ‘virtue’ == ‘the virtuous man,’ is said to be ²⁴]
always consul. Bentley has collected a number of similar instances -

from all Latinity; ‘animus lucis contemptor,' Virg. Aen. 9. 205,
‘ animus liberator,’ ‘carnifex‚’ ‘proscriptor,’ &o Cp. Sat. 1. 4. 18
‘animi, raro et perpauca loquentis.’ But the expression becomes
harsh and embarrassed when the mind is said to be a ‘ consul of
more than one year,' by virtue of its behaviour as a judge. Ritter
thinks that this was sostened by a consciousness in the poet and '
his readers of the current etymology of ‘consul' as = ‘qui bene
consulit,' Varr. L. L. 5. 80. At any rate the harshness is softened
by the distance of the words from ‘‚ animus.’ With ‘ consul’ we

take up the notion of Lollius, himself the ex-consul, and cease to -

feel that we are speaking of his mind, not of him. We may
compare the way in which ⁴ sententia’ is used in Epp. 1. 1. 97—100‚
the verbs being at first such as it may naturally stand as subject to,
but changing, as the clauses go on, to those which presume Horace
himself to be their subJect.

40—44. sed quotiens . . . arma. ‘ Sed quotiens’ answering to
‘non unius anni,’ ‘ consul, not of one year, but in perpetuity‚
so often as,’ ἃς. ., ‘quotiens’ being understood before the second

and third clauses. Orelli compares 3. 24. 40 foll. where‘ si,' and ἑ
4. 8. 31 foll. where‘ sic,’ are similarly omitted. Of the Scholiasts ’

Porph. alone takes the stanza in a different way, making‘ explicuit
. . victor’ the apodosis to‘ quotiens iudex . . . praetulit . . . reiecit-²
‘ So often as on the judgement-seat it resists the temptations of

expediency and bribery, it is a conqueror as much as if it were Α

scattering foemen in real battle.’ The construction 'is not any
easier, and the flow of the lines is less easy, than if ‘ sed quotiens ’
gave at once the full antithesis to‘ non unius anni,' and started us
on a fresh thought; but Porph. seems to be followed, among recent
editors, if we may judge by their punctuation, by Keller and
Munro. The question is partly mixed up with the further doubt
as to the reference of the whole stanza. Porph? 5 construction is

only admissible on the view (which Orelli supports) that it refers =

entirely to Lollius’ civil life, his conduct as a ‘iudex selectus’
(Sat. 1.4. 123), the last two l'ines being metaphorical.1t must be
allowed, however, that under the circumstances of Lollius, and
seeing how lightly his military exploits would in that case be
passed over, it would be a somewhat double-edged compliment
