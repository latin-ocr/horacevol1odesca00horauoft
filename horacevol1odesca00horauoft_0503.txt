Α HoRACE’s ΗΒΕ OF THE COMPLEMENTARY
‘INFINITIVE WITH VERBS AND ADJECTIVES

Ὀ ⁷ 1. With ⁴ Verjbs,

A COMPLEMENTA'RY, or, as Dr. Kennedy preferred to call it, ‘ pro-
lative,’ infinitive seems properly to have been allowed only to verbs
whose idea was not complete without such a definition of their
scope, whether the simple verbs that express power, duty, inclina-
tion, purpose, effort‚ beginning, &c., and the negation of any of μ
these (‘ possum,' ‘‚’debeo ‘vo,'lo ‘‚’conor ‘incipio,’ ‘nequeo,’

‘nolo ’;) or again the simple verbs which express the allowing

another, or influencing him, to do or abstain from doing something
(‘ sino ‘patior,’ ‘iube0‚' ‘doceo‚’‘ cogo,’ ‘‚’veto ‘prohibeo,’ &c.).
There is a tendency, however, even in the most classical prose
writers to extend the first at least of these two classes by including
verbs which do not properly require any such complement‚ and
which therefore, if any further definition of their scope or purpose
were needed, would in strictness have found it rather by means
either of some subordinate clause or of one of those substantival
forms of the verb which could indicate its special relation more
exactly ‚than is possible with the caseless infinitive. Thus we find
with the infinitive, ‘studeo,' Cic.; ‘nitor,’ Nep.; ‘quaero‚' Cic.;
‘tendo,' Liv.; ‘pergo,’ Cic.; ‘persevero,’ Cic. Many verbs
hesitate between the two constructions, ‘statuo facere' or ‘ut
faciam,' ‘prohibeo facere’ or ‘quominus facias? The poets go
beyond the prose writers in this extension, greatly because their
diction substitutes more highly-coloured and metaphorical verbs
for the simplet ones of prose, ‘ gaude0,’ ‘gesti0,' ‘amo,' ‘ ardeo‚' for
‘volo,' &c.; but Livy and Sallust anticipate some of the boldest
poetical applications of this liberty.

It seems useless to seek a full explanation of each case in the
doctrine that the infinitive was truly a substantive, which involves
the further difficulty that we must explain in what relation (or
‘case') it stands to the leading verb (see Conington's note on
virg. G. 1. 213). A Roman poet felt at once the influence of
Greek usage, in which the infinitive never lost its substantival
, character, and of Latin precedents, which, if they may be traced
ultimately to a similar source, had yet ceased to be coloured by
any consciousness of it. That the infinitive is treated at times by
