an apology for the style of writing as in Sat. ii or a quasi-dedicatory
address as in the Epodes, Sat. i, and both Books of the Epistles.
And there are reasons frequently to be detected for the juxta-
position or separation of particular poems. In the Epodes‚ for
instance, we notice especially the metrical arrangement of 1—10,
11—16‚ 17, and the distribution at intervals of poems upon the same
subject, such as those upon Canidia (5 and 17) and those in which
he touches politics (1, 7, 9, 16) ¹.

ξ 12. It is natural that the art expended on the arrangement of
the Odes² should be greater. The moods which they reflect are
more various, and the poems are of a kind which has more to gain
by contrast or preparation. But there is a greater reason in the
delicacy of the ground upon which they enter, in respect to the
politics of the time. Horace has in them to justify his change of
sides, neither to ignore nor to make too much of it—he has to
praise with tact one, ‘ cui male si palpere, recalcitrat ’--he has with
dignity and without offence to do justice to old friendships and old
ideals. In this task he takes refuge in the irony, partly a method
of his art, partly a natural instinct, ‘parcentis viribus atque ex-
tenuantis eas consulto,’ which marks so deeply all his writings ³.
It enables him in Satires and Epistles to preach without seeming

latest in the Book. In Epp. ii the first of the two Epistles is to be dated
six or seven years later than the second. In Sat. ii the first Satire seems
to carry in it a reference to Β. c. 30, the year of the publication of the
13010ιὲοτ instances in the Satires and Epistles, see vol. ii. pp. 14 and 210.

² The case of Odes iv is dealt with fully in the introduction to that
Book. The art of the arrangement is more generally recognized in it than
in the three earlier Books, only because the material to be disposed is
smaller in quantity, and because the purpose of the Book is more fully
avpugg.its artistic side this irony is nearly connected with another feature
os his style which will be noticed on 2. 19 (Introd. and on ν. 31), 3. 5. 56,
and 4. 2. 57, namely his affectation, in poems where we have been wronght
higher than usual, of a dull, even conventional, ending, as though the
passion ought to die away in a diminuendo before the strain ceases. This
