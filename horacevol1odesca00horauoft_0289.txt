BOOK II, ODE IV, 17—ODE VI

’ ‘temptare.’ Dium, however, follows Mitsch. in taking ‘ferox'

of the flight of time, ⁴ like an unbroken horse,’ as Ov. F ast. 6. 772
‘ fugiunt freno non remorante dies!
14. dempserit . . . apponet, a ground for not being impatient.

,, ‘ If you are losing the years fast, she is gaining them as fast! Each
5 fresh year of life is a year added or a year taken away, according to

our point of view. Compare the double phrase by which Horace

‘ expresses the lapse of time in Od. 3. 30. 5 ‘annorum series et fuga

. temporum. ’ So Seneca de Cons. ad Marc. 20 ‘Quo quisque primum
ι lucem vidit iter mortis ingressus est, accessitque fato propior; et
illi ipsi qui adiciebantur adolescentiae anni vita detrahebantur.’
Cp. Soph. Aj. 475 παρ’ ᾗμαρ ἡμέρα . . . προσθεῖσα κάναθεῖσα τοῦ γε
= κατθανεῖν. To the impatient lover time seems to be robbing him of

⁷ year after year, and to be making no difference to Lalage, to be

⁶ galloping ' with him while it ‘ crawls ’ or stands still with her, cp.
Epp. 1. 1. 20 foll. Such expressions as A. P. 17 5 anni venientes,
recedentes' (cp. Od. 2. 11. 5), Soph. Trach. 547 ὁρῶ γὰρ ἥβην τὴν μὲν

of life. They suppose an ἀκμή, a definite point to which life ascends
and from which it descends. Horace does notmean here to repre-
} sent his lover as going down the hill of life.

’ 15. proterva fronte, a return to the metaphor of stanzas 1, 2.
17. dilecta, sc. ‘a te.’ ‘ Lalage, whom you love with a passion

' you never felt for any other! His re· -eminent love for Lalage is '

the measure both of the happiness or which he is bidden to wait
· and of the impatience with which he waits for it.

ι. Pholoe fugax, see on Od. 1. 33. 6‘ asperam Pholoen.' Her
” ssight is one which attracts pursuit, ‘fugit ad salices et se cupit ante

' videri?

17— 20. non, non, ve, cp. Od. 2. 9. ‚1-—6‘ non‚’ ‘aut,’‘ nec,’ ‘.aut ¹
19. pura, Od. 3. 29. 45 ‘sole puro, 'free from mist or cloud.
renidet, in what is its first sense, ‘shines against Od. 2. 18. 2
,- ‘aureum . . . renidet lacunar’ ; Epod. 2. 66‘ renidentis lares.¹

ζ , 22. mire, with ‘ falleret! ·

⁴ hospites, strangers who came in.

ODE VI

‘SEPT1M1U5‚ my dear friend who would aceompany me to the
ends of the earth, let me spend the end of my life at Tibur, or if not

{lffrledthen at Tarentum. Let us go there together and live there
1 1e

Septimius has been naturally supposed to be the same person
whom Horace introduces to Tiberius in Epp. 1. 9. He may also
probably be the common friend of the poet and the emperor named
ιιι the letter of Augustus preserved in the Suetonian life of Horace.
