GENERAL INTRODUCTION

tersus, at the end of the Epodes in A, λ, l, R⁸,g. ‘Vettius Agorius
Basilius Mavortius v. c. et inl. (vir clarissimus et inlustris) excom.
dom. excons. ord. (excomite domestico, exconsule ordinario) legi
et ut potui emendavi, conferente mihi magistro Felice oratore urbis
Romae.' Felix is not known, but Mavortius was consul in the
year A. D. 527. Asterius, consul 494, is similarly connected with
the history of the text of Virgil. Bentley had treated this Mavortian
recension as the ultimate point to which the oldest MSS. might be
expected to take us back. Keller and Holder treat it rather as the
first, though not the worst, source of systematic corruption. The
most important fact with respect to this class is that Keller places
in it B, V with g, and in respect of many of the readings A. d

The third class is held to have been subjected to earlier and less
intelligent corruption than the second. As a whole, therefore, it
exhibits a worse text, more blunders and fatuities. On the other
hand it is tenacious of the true text where the intelligent inter-
polators of class 2 have obscured it. In it are placed generally
F (= φψ), λ’ (= λ Ζ), u, π, σ, and others.

The canon on which Keller and Holder rely in using this classifi-
cation is that the common reading of two classes is to be preferred
to that of the third. It is essential therefore to the value of the
system that the existence of the three classes should be clearly
made out: otherwise it is merely the testimony of some of the
older MSS. against others. It is here that criticism has been most
damaging to them ¹. It is pointed out that the natural basis for
the theory of a triple recension is wanting, inasmuch as the
existence of three distinctive variants in doubtful passages is not
only not frequent, it is confessedly extremely rare ². The classes
are recognized not by distinctive readings but by the general type
of their aberrations from the supposed original text. But here

¹ I would refer for a vigorous criticism of the principles of Keller and .
{older's classification to an article by Dr. James Gow in the Classical

eview, vol. iv· . .

‘² See Dr. Goliv'saez’litiele, p. 339. He can find in Keller's ‘apparatus
criticus’ only seven cases of three substantial variants, one ascribed to each
class, viz.: Od. 1. 12. 3 retinet, recinet, recinit; 1. 12. 15 et, ac, aut;
2. 11. 24 comas, comae, comam; 2. 13. 2 3 descriptas, discriptas, discretas;
3. 24. 4 publicum, Ponticum, Apulicum; 3. 27. 55 defluet, defluit, defluat.
Sat. 1. 2. 12 Fufidius, Futidius, F usidius.
