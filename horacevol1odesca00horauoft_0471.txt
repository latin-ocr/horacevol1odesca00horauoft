EPODE 111, 4——EPODE IV, 9

35. Various difficulties have been felt in this identification. The
absence of any mention of the fickleness and treachery of Menas,
has been thought to fix the date of the Epode, if it refers to him, to
the period between his first desertion of Sextus Pompeius and his
return to his service in 36. Yet during that time he was serving
with the fleet which he had carried over to Octavianus‘ side ; and,
though he may have visited Rome, he can hardly have become as
familiar a sight to the Roman populace as is implied by vv. 11-16.
The office of ‘tribunus militum’ seems also a strange one to be
selected (Horace would choose the highest that he filled) for the
commander of a fleet. Several MSS.‚ including B and A, head the
Epode with the words ‘Ad Sextum Menam libertinum. Vedium
Rufum ex servitute miratur usurpasse equestrem dignitatem usque
ad tribunatum militum‚’ with no sign that the two inscriptions are
inconsistent or alternative; a common mistake, which seems to
lead us back to some common authority of greater antiquity. Of
the two names offered, Menas was a likely guess to any one who
knew the history of the time, and therefore carries with it less
probability than the entirely unknown name of Vedius Ruqu, to
which there was nothing in the text or in the generally known
histories to lead a copyist or annotator. Orelli shows from an
inscription that Rufus is found among the cognomina of the Vedii.

1. Epod. 15. 7, a proverb sor implacable hate; Hom. Il. 22. 262
Οὐδὲ λύκοι τε καὶ ἄρνες ὁμόφρονα θυμὸν ἔχουσιν, Ι ἀλλὰ κακὰ φρονέουσι
διαμπερὲς ἀλλήλοισιν· Ι ὣς οὐκ ἔστ’ ἐμὲ καὶ σὲ φιλήμεναι.

sortito obtigit, a phrase found also in Plautus, Merc. 1. 2. 24.

3. Hibericis, of Spanish broom3 Plin. N. H. 19. 1 and 7. Quin-
tilian (8. 2) laughs at an advocate who spoke of ‘herbae Hibericae ’
meaning ‘ Spartum‚’ though no one in court knew what he meant.
Those who identify the object of the Epode with Menas, notice the
connexion of Sextus Pompeius with Spain, and also the appropriate-
ness of the instrument of punishment to one who had spent his life
on shipboard. In the army the centurion was armed with a ‘ vitis.'

peruste3 Epp. 1. 16. 47 ‘loris non ureris.'

7. metiente, walking from end to end of it. The ‘ Sacra via'
was a lounge of men of leisure3 Sat. 1. 9. 1.

8. trium, a conjecture—for all the MSS. which write the word
in full have ‘ ter,' which is senseless. B, however, has i, an abbre-
viation wrongly expanded in the other MSS. The sense of the
true reading is given by Aer. and Porph., ‘ cum sex ulnarum toga.’
For the broad ‘toga, spread out by the elbows as a sign of

importance, cp. Sat. 2. 3. 183 ‘ Latus ut in Circo spatiere,’ Epp. 1. ·

18. 30 ‘Arta decet sanum comitem toga,’ Cic. Cat. 2. 10. 22 ‘ velis
amicti non togis.²

9. ora vertat, ‘ make them turn away,’ Schol. ; ‘ make them turn
to look,' Ritter. If we may interpret Horace by himself, it will
mean neither, but rather ‘ make their countenances change’3 cp.
Sat. 2. 8. 35 ‘ vertere pallor Tum parochi saciem.’
