„ bVlixei,for the form cp. ‘ Achillei,’ 1. 15. 34, ancl see Madv.§ 38,
Α o S. 3.

8. Pelopis domum, the theme rather of the Greek drama than
of Epos; but Horace is probably alluding to Varius’ tragedy
Thyestes, which was brought out in the year after the battle of
Actium. It was greatly admired: ‘Varii Thyestes cuilibet Grae-

J corum comparari potest,’ Quint. 10. 1. 98.

10. lyrae potens, Od. 1. 3. 1.

ἶ, vetat, see on Od. 1. 3. 10.

’ Verr. 2. 5. 1 ‘obteri laudem imperatoriam criminibus avaritiae‚' and

ἲ· ‘tenuaref Hor. Od. 3. 3. 72.

χ· 13. quis. ‘Who can?’=‘how few can!' We are not all
Homer-s, like Varius.

1 tunica tectum adamantina, χολκοχὶτωναε ‘adamas‚’ is hard

steless pulvere nigrum. Cp. 2. 1. 22. The ‘dust' of the Trojan

ἶ, plain occupies a prominent place in Homer.

16. superis parem, referring to his wounding Aphrodite and

Δ ⁸ Ares, in Hom. ll. 5, see esp. vv. 881-884⁶ H (sc. Pallas) νῦν Τυδέος

υἱὸν ὑπερφίαλον Διομήδεα Ι μαργαίνειν ἀνέηκεν ἐπ’ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι. Ι

Κύπριδα μὲν πρῶτον ο-χεδὸν οὔτασε χεῖρ’ ἐπι καρπῷ, Ι αὐτὰρ ἔπειτ’ αὐτῷ
’ ·· μοι ἐπέσσυτο δαίμονι’ ισος.

,· 18. sectis unguibus, ‘with ’ -not, as ‘proelia' leads us to
expect, drawn swords, but—‘ pared nails,' a woman ’s weapon.1t
³ is doubted what is the exact force of‘ sectis! Some (as Ritter)

think‘ cut to a point, so as to scratch better’· , others (as Orelli)
‘trimmed so as not to hurt,' the opposite of ‘irresectum unguem’

. ς in Epod. 5. 47 of claw- like nails. It 1s then meant to contrast with

‘acrium,' pointing out that it is a parody. Bentley proposed

- 1 ‘strictis' as helping the point of ‘ proelia' and the παρὰ προσδοκίαν
, 3 substitution of ‘ unguibus' for‘ ensibus? and it derives some colour
‘from Ovid’ s ‘ Non timeo strictas in mea fata manus,' Am. 1.6. 14.

19. vaem, see on Od. 1. 5. 10. For the omission of the first

Ψ ‘sive' see on Od. 1. 3.16.

. not, habitually given to light and fanciful themes ; ‘ iocosae Musae
j dediti ': cp. Od. 3. 3. 69 ‘iocosae lyrae.’

ODE VII

‘ THE world' is full of fair spotS, but your own Tibur is the fairest

Forget your troubles, Plancus; in camp, or here in Tibur, d1own
v, care in wine. Remember how Teucer put a bold face on his
calamity, and found a new Salamis to make up for the old.’
