THE EPODES OF HORACE

EPODE X

’‘P-ROPEMPTICON 1N1M1co Pomm) Contrast it with the be·
gmnmg of Od. 1. 3. Very little is known of Maevius beyond the
fact of his being the special enemy of Virgil as well as of Horace.
‘ Qui Bavium non odit, amet tua carmina, Maevi‚' Ecl. 3. 90. The
few doubtful stories connected with him will be found in Smith's
Dict. Biog. under the name of Bavius.

‘Bad luck go with the ship that bears Maevius. May each wind
play its part in wrecking it. May never a star show itself. Be the
sea as rough as when Pallas sank Ajax on his way home from Troy.
Methinks I see the storm-the sailors toiling and you pale and
praying as the hull goes to picceS. May you be thrown on shore
and seed the cormorantS.’

Ο 2. ferens olentem. The two words combine in the image. It
1s an unsavoury cargo.

3—8. Contrast Od. 1. 3. 4, ‘ Obstrictis aliis praeter Iapyga.’

’10. qua, the antecedent is ‘nocte '3 the night of Orion's setting
wssl be a stormy one on which the guidance of the stars would be
welcome. Od. 1. 28. 21, 3. 27. 18, Epod. 15. 7.

tristis, as ‘tristis Hyadas,’ Od. 1. 3. 14.

12. Graia victorum manus. For the relation of the adjective
we may compare Od. 1. 29. 5 ‘ Quae virginum barbara,' and 3. 29.
1 ‘ Tyrrhena regum progenies.'

13, 14. For the death of Ajax, the son of Oileus, see Hom. Od.
4. 502 foll„ Virg. Aen. 1. 39 foll.

1G9. Ionius, the lower part of the Adriatic. Maevius is crossing
to reece.

21. opima, ‘ apparet et pinguem eum fuisse,’ Porph.

22. iuverit. Many editors have received ‘iuveris' on the
authority of the Comm. Cruq., who explains it by, ‘ paveris.’ If
we retain the third person, ‘ praeda ’ is the direct subject.

23, 24. The sacrifices usually offered for the preservation of
mariners he vows if Maevius suffers shipwreck. Virg. Aen. 5. 772
‘ Tempestatibus agnam Caedere deinde iubet.’

EPODE XI >

‘I HAVE no heart for poetry. A different passion has smitten
me. I am the victim of Love in a way that no one else is. Three
years ago it was Inachia. I was the talk of the town: my moody
ways, my loud complaints that she preferred money to merit, my
resolutions to free myself, and my repeated return to slavery. Now
it is another. Neither advice nor rebuffs will cure me. The only
relies that 1 can look for is some new passion.'
