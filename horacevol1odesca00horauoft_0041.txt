ODES, BOOKS I-III

principle of arrangement, whether within the separate Books or as
between them, it is not chronological ¹. The only Ode that can be
with confidence dated as early as 13.c. 30 is 1. 37. Of two Odes
which can be definitely placed in B.c. 24 one is in the third Book,
the other in the first (3. 14, 1. 24). Od. 1. 12 belongs almost cer-
tainly to the later years of that period. The Odes which turn on
the two synchronous personal events, the poet’s escape from the
falling tree and the recovery of Maecenas from dangerous illness,
are distributed between the three Books, and the one which must
be latest in composition (1. 20) is in the first Book. The view
based on such considerations is seen to harmonize with indications
of unity within the poems themselves. 1t seems to be implied in
the analogy which we notice between the dedication of Epp. 1. 1
ancl 19, and of Od. 1. 1 and 3. 29 to Maecenas, while in each case ,
'the last poem in the collection, Epp. 1. 20, Od. 3. 30, is reserved for
the poet’s literary sels-consciousness. The references in Book iv
treat the three preceding Books as a whole—as e. g. in the relation
of 4. 1 to 1. 19 and 3. 26, as one of the earliest and the latest of the
love Odes of his earlier poetry. Above all, it is only when this
unity is recognized that we perceive that full significance in the
arrangement of the Odes* which the example of the F ourth Book
5 prepares us to expect ².

ξ 11. Some kind of conscious arrangement subsequent to com-
position, and not chronological, is obvious on the face of the
Epodes‚ Satires, and EpistleS. There is at least the choice of the
opening poem, not usually ³, if ever, earliest in date of composition,

’ the Books and the order of the Odes as they are have the right of undisputed

tradition. One MS. only depaxts from them (viz. B), and that, as will

“ be seen from the account given of it on p. 5, bears, though in another
. way, witness to the usual arrangement. Diomedes, the writer on metre
ι (quoted by Priscian and therefore not later than the fifth century), refers to
. the Odes by their present numbering.

² It may be added that if, as is generally believed, Epp. 1. 13 refers to
the presentation of the Odes to Augustus, it is in accordance with the

’ current view that Horace speaks of the poenis sent as ‘libelli,' ‘fasciculus

librorum‚’ in contrast with his use of the singular ‘libellus’ of the First
Book os the Satires in Sat. 1. ιο. 92. ·
