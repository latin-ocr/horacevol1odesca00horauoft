GENERAL INTRODUCTION

be distinctly given as from the ‘Bland. vetustissimus’ or from
‘omnes Blandinii.’ He makes it clear that no argument can be
drawn as to its readings from his silence, or from any less definite
descriptions‚ such as ‘tres Bland.', ‘unus Bland. ², or even ‘codd.
Bland.’ (3) That the use of his testimony must be strictly confined
to the particular point for the sake of which his note shows that the
reference is made, his practice being evidently in other respects to
quote from memory or inexactly. A good instance occurs in
Od. 4. 6. 28, where in the edition of 1565 he apparently gives
‘Laetus Agyieu’ as the reading of V, whereas in the edition of
1578 he gives ‘ Laetus Agylleu.’ The notes, however, show that in
his earlier edition he was merely concerned with the variation of
‘laetus ' for ‘ levis.’ There are indications that he was aware of the
second variation of ‘Agylleu,' but set it aside as having found no
other authority for the word. In 1578 he had found, as he thought,
support for it in Strabo, and gives it therefore as the reading which
he had seen in V and was now prepared to justify. It is such an
instance as this which in less equitable construction had led to the
imputations of carelessness and even bad saith which have been
made against him. The general conclusions with respect to the
MS. seem to be:

(1) That Cruquius overrated its actual age. According to his
own testimony it was in cursive writing, and therefore was probably
not older than the ninth century.

(2) That it was of uneven merit, the best readings from it being
chiefly in the Satires and Epistles‚ while in the Odes it had some
readings which bear signs of interpolation, as Od. 4. 2. 6.

(3) That in spite of such limitations it is of unique value, not
merely as a good MS. amongst other good oneS, but as giving, in
parts of Horace at least, some readings which have every appear-
ance of genuineness, and yet of which there is no trace in any
existing MS. except in g, a Gotha MS. of the fifteenth century,
which presumably gained them from it. Such is the famous
‘ Campum lusumque trigonem ’ in Sat. 1. 6. 126, where every other
MS. but g reads the incredible ‘ rabiosi tempora signi.’ In other
words it gives us access to a tradition of the text independent of
that of the other MSS.
