BOOK IV, ODE IX, 37-0DE XI, 3

to speak of him as ‘a great conqueror‚' with the tacit addition of
‘ metaphorically and in a moral sense.’

44. explicuit, much like ‘expedivit,' ‘has carried safely through!
Livy has ‘ explicare sugam,’ 1. 30.

45 to end. A picture of the ideal ‘wise man’; cp. 2. 2. 17.
Horace at once holds it out for Lollius' own contemplation, and
suglr1gests tqhis calumniators that such had been Lollius’ real bearing

ODE X

‘THE day will come, Ligurinus, when your youthful good looks
will pass away, and you will repent that you ever gave yourself
such airs on the strength of them.'

Metre—Second Asclepz'ad.

2. pluma, ‘down,' of the first beard. No other instance of the
use is quoted. Dacier understood it as = ‘penna,' ‘when your
youthful pride shall take to itself wings.' Bentley wished to read
‘bruma.’

superbiae is the dative with ‘veniet,' and probably, as the
collocation shows, also with ‘insperata‚’ ‘ shall come to thy pride,
though it dreams not of it.'

3. deciderint, i. e. shall have been cut, the sign of manhood.

ODE XI

‘ MY wine is ready, and we are all astir preparing the feast3 sor
it is the Ides of April, Maecenas' birthday. Corne, then, Phyllis,
and keep it with me; never mind Telephus. What are such
ambitious loves to you? Corne, thou last of my flames (it shall be
so, 1 swear), corne, and let us sing together!

Compare 3. 28, where he invites Lyde to spend the Neptunalia
with him. The point of this Ode seems to lie, not in the invitation
to Phyllis, which is only an incident in the holiday-keeping, but in
the occasion, Maecenas’ birthday.

Whether the Ode was written at the time of the leading Odes
of the Book is perhaps more than we can say3 but it characterizes
fitly the relations of the poetssand his early patron at that time.

See Introd. to the Book.

1. Alban ranked among the better Italian wines 3 Sat. 2. 8. 16.
It was a strong wine that bore a good deal of keeping.
