THE ODES OF HORACE

et arcus. ‘Quibus ianitores terrerent’ is the note in R⁸‚ the

‘l

i

MS. in Queen's College (Oxford) Library. Cp. 3.·14. 23. It is an 3
odd weapon for the purpose, and, as Bentley complains, the ξ
⁴ oppositae fores’ would have protected the porter. He alters ‘et
arcus’ boldly to ‘securesque’3 Keller defends the rather strange ”
conjecture ‘ ascias‚’ a rare word for an axe. Other meanings have =

been suggested for ‘ arcus: such as ‘ catapults ’ or ‘levers‚’ but they
are unsupported.

9, 10. It is common to preface prayers by recalling various titles z
and sacred places of the god who is addressed. ‘ Cyprus’ is the g
well-known seat of Venus’ worship3 see 1. 3. 1. Why ‘ Memphis’ ..
is named is not so clear. Hdt. (2. 112) and Strabo (17, p. 1161) ᾗ
mention a temple of Ἀφροδιτὴ-ξείνη there. A line of Bacchylides Ξ
(37, Bergk) has been preserved: τὴν ἀχείμαντόν τε Μέμφιν καὶ δονα-
κώδεα Νεῖλον, of which possibly an echo is heard in the epithet of¹ ξ

Memphis here; but the connexion of the verse is not known.
Probably, as Dillr. and Ritter think, ‘ carentem nive' is an appeal
to Venus against the icy heart of Chloe: ‘Etenim frigus ut in
rerum natura ita in hominum pectoribus odiosum est Veneri!
Dius.

10. Sithonia; 1. 18. 9.

11, 12. Venus is for the moment armed with the lash, which

belongs rather to the Furies‚ to punish offences against herself.
‘ Sublimi‚’ ‘ lifted high for the blow.' -

ODE XXVII

‘ BAD omens are for the bad. If 1 fear for you, I will at least wish
you all good omens. Go, if you must go, and be happy wherever
you are; and think of me sometimes, Galatea. Only remember
the season. 1 have reason to know what a stormy passage of the
Adriatic is like 3 may no friend of mine ever experience it! Europa
didn't know on what she was embarking, till she found herself on
the seas and saw nothing but sky and water. Then she repented
bitterly, till Venus consoled her!

It is possible that the conclusion of Europa’s story loses its imme-
diate point from our not knowing the circumstances of Galatea's
journey. Was she too, it has been suggested, to find consolation
in the wealth and greatness of the companion of her travel? There
is no passion, though there is tenderness and kindlineSS, in the
poet's feeling towards her. The Ode contrasts in this respect with
the similar poems of Propertius (1. 8) and Ovid (Am. 2. 11).

‘In any case Horace meant people to read his Ode who knew

episodes, it only touches at one point the subject with which the ’

Ode begins. The story of Europa is told in Ov. Met. 2. 847 soll.
