BOOK III, ODE XXIV, 1-13

herself? He will have the toil, but he will not finish the work
himself. Death will stop him. We may remember that ‘ nails for
building,’ ‘clavi trabales,’ are already a recognized implement of
‘Necessitas,' 1. 35. 18 ; so that Horace would say, ‘ You are build-
ing. Fate is a builder as well as you, and she may finish your
house for you.' The plural ‘verticibus' may be explained as
generalizing, —‘ the tops of your palacesss for he 1s building in every
sea,-—or of the different points to which the roof rises. Two other
explanations have been given to‘ summis verticibus? (1) Bentley’ s
—of the nails,‘ up to their heads’ ;(2) that of most of the older
commentators—of the heads that tower highest, are ‘too con-

spicuous,’ Od. 3. 16. 19; or more definitely still, ‘ of the top of the
head’ of the human proprietor into which Doom is pictured as
driving her nails. Professor Robinson Ellis suggested to me as
parallel for this last view, Theog n. 1012 κεφαλῆς δ’ ἅπτεται ἄκρο-

τάτης (spoken of old age), and a fraggment (3) of Rhianus in Meineke’ s

adamantinos, of hardest iron‚ see on 1. 6. 13. It does not help
the image of F ate finishing his work for him, but it suggests the
further idea of the hopelessness of struggling with Fate. It is
parallel to the images of 1. 35. 16-20. See note there.

7, 8. The thought ofdeath and thedoom of death are both
represented as a halter round the neck, from which there is *no
release, ts (we should rather put it in prose—since there is the
ppssibilz‘ty that) an irreversible Fate has already fixed the limit
o our lans.

12. immetata, ἅπαξ λεγ. The absence of divisions of property
is a characteristic of the golden age in Virg. G. 1. 126‘ Ne signare

i‘mmetata’ with‘ iugera, ’which is a measure of surface, has the
effect of an oxymoron.

13. fruges et Cererem, εν διὰ δυοῖν, probably like‘ gemmas et
lapides‚’ v. 48; the double substantive is meant to express univer-
sality,‘ fruits of the ground of every kind!
