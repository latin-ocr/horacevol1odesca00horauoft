ODES. BOOK 1v

ODE I

‘ AGAIN a summons to arms, Venus! No, spare me3 it is not .

with me in my tenth lustre as it was in the days of poor Cinara.
Away, then, to the house of Paulus Maximus. High-born‚ and

handsome, and eloquent, and accomplished, he will bear thy .

colours more worthily, and, when the victory is won, will pay thee

richer honour. Ι am too old to love, to drink, to play. Yet what

am I saying? my heart gives the lie to my words.’

On the meaning which this Ode acquires from its place at the
beginning of this Book see Introd. to Book iv.

Metre— Third A sclepiad.

1. The language of this Ode answers to that of 3. 26, in which
Horace declares his love-campaigns at an end. In both places the
image is not of Venus attacking the heart of a lover, but of

a warfare carried on with her weapons and under her auspices, ⁴

in which the poet has once served, and is now called to serve
agildltiermissa, sc. ‘ bella)
no} ἓξὲξ ‚esum qualis3 cp. Epp. 1. 1. 4 ‘ Non eadem est aetaS‚

bonae. Perhaps, as Dillr. thinks (quoting Lucr. 3. 1037 ‘bonus ’

Ancus ⁹), the epithet implies that she has been some time dead.

4. sub regn03 see on Od. 1. 36. 8, and compare especially 3.
‘9d 9 ᾗ me nunc Thraessa Chloe regit,' 2. 8. 18, 19 ‘servitus‚’

ommae!

Oc{Por Cinara see Appendix 1 ‘on the unknown names in the
es.’

5. mater saeva Cupidinum. This line is intentionally repeated
from 1. 19. 1. There Venus is invoked at the outset of the love
campaign3 here, after it was or should have been closed. It is
the ἄρχετε βωκολικᾶς and the λήγετε βωκολικᾶς, the altered refrain of
the whole. '‘ Dulcium‚’ ‘saeva,’ imply that he is balancing the
bitters and sweets of the old life.

6. eirca, of time, ‘hard upon my fiftieth year! The metaph. of ·

‘flectere ⁹ is of breaking horses. He is too old and hard-mouthed
now for the soft guidance of Venus’ rein. Cp. for the expressions
V irg. G. 3. 188 ‘det mollibus ora capistris Invalidus,’ δια, and
ib. 165 ‘ Dum faciles animi iuvenum, dum mobilis aetas,’ διο.
