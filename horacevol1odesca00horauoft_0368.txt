THE ODES OF HORACE

cannot attend to her womanly work for the thought of Hebrus'
beauty—Hebrus, as he comes fresh from his swim in the Tiber
after his morning's exercise‚ for he is the best of riders, boxers,
runners, huntsmen.’

The older theory made it all an address of the poet to N eobule.
But in his mouth the contrast of the lot of men and women is not
very graceful, nor the connexion between vv. 1—3 and the remainder
of the Ode very clear, nor the recital of Hebrus’ aecemplish'r'nents
very appropriate. Ritter, allowing the whole to be put into
N eobule’s mouth, makes vv. 4—12 the ‘ patruae verbera linguae’
which she imagines to herself. The uncle, however, would hardly
spend the greater part of his scolding in praising her lover. .

The verse which Hephaestion quotes, to illustrate the Ionic
metre, from the beginning of a poem of Alcaeus, ἔμε δείλαν ἔμε
παισᾶν κακοτάτων πεδέχοισαν, reads as if Alcaeus’ Ode had been in
some way the original of this one, and it favours also the view that
Neobule is speaking in this Ode of herself.

Metre—Ionicum a minore. See Index of Metres 10.

1. dare ludum, ‘to humour‚’ ‘to give its pleasure to ’ ; ‘ desidiae
dare ludum,’ Plaut. Bacch. 4. 10. 9. ’

2. mala vino lavere. The coarseness to our taste is explained
by Dillr. as belonging to ‘Graeci mores'3 by Orelli as parallel to
‘ sapias, vina liques,’ ‘multi Damalis meri,' &c.‚ and as implying
that N eobule was a ‘libertina.’ Perhaps it may be better mitigated
by observing that the contrast in Neobule's mind is not so much
between one girl and another as between the lot of women and
that of men. The latter have the choice of indulging their love or
forgetting it in wine. ‘ Poor women ' cannot do either.

aut.. The alternative ι5, etther not to do either of these things
or, if we do them, to feel the terrors of an uncle's tongue. Cp. 3.
24. 24 ‘peccare nefas aut pretium est mori!

3. patruae,‘ an uncle' s tongue' was proverbial. Sat. 2. 3. 88

‘ne sis patruus mihi’ ; Cic. pro Cael. 11. 25ι qui in reliqua vita
mitis esset. .fuit in hac causa pertristis quidam patruus, censor,
magister?

4. qualum, a wicker basket of any kind, here the basket which
held the wool; ‘calatham μετωνυμικῶς pro lanificio dicit,’ Acr
Comp. for the idea Sapph. Fr. 91 γλυκεῖα μᾶτερ, οὗτοι δύναμαι
κρέκην τὸν ἴστον πόθῳ ὃάμεισα παῖδος βραδίναν δι’ Ἀφρ οδὶταν.

5. operosae- = Ἐργάνης, an epithet of Pallas, especially as the
patroness of women’ 5 work, see Lidd. and Scott 5. ν.

6. Liparaei Hebri, see on 3. 7. 23 ‘ Enipeus.² ‘ Liparaei,' from
Lipara, the largest and only inhabited island of the Aeoliae 1⁸⁹
between the coasts of Sicily and Lucania. For the local designa-
tion see on 2. 4. Introd. The special place seems to owe its
selection to the metrical convenience of its name. The same is
the case with‘ Neobule' 3 see on ‘‚'Leuconoe 1. 11. 2.
