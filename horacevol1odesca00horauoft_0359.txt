ODE VIII

THE Ode is written for an expected or imagined visit of
Maecenas, on the first anniversary of the poet’s narrow escape from
the falling tree (2. 13, 2. 17. 27, 3. 4. 27). The festival of March 1
was the Matronalia. Maecenas is supposed on his entry to wonder
what can be the reason that a bachelor’ s home shows preparation
for sacrifice on such a day. The answer is, that the poet is paying
a vow to Bacchus, which he had ‘made at the time of his miraculous
preservation. ‘The best wine is to be brought out‚' and so the
Ode passes into an invitation to Maecenas to enter into the spirit
of the time—to forget the troubles of State. ‘All is going well;
the Dacians are checked, the Parthians quarrelling among them-
selves, even the Cantabrian subdued at last, and the Scythians
unstringing their bows; Maecenas may enjoy a little privacy and
immunity from care.’
