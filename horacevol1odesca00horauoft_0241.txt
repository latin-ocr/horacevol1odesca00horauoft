ODE XXII

‘D1 me tuentur: dis pietas mea
et musa cordi est? Od.1.17.13.

ἓ The protection from com'rnon dangers accorded to the poet’s

fa flocks 1s extended to himself. As a child, n‘on sine Dis animosus?

’ he is covered by the wood· pigeons from the snakes and bears of

. Mount Vultur (Od. 3. 4). Mercury snatches him from the folly and

y danger of civil war into which his boyish enthusiasm had carried

’ him (Od. 2. 7). Faunus (Od. 2. 17) wards off from him the falling
tree. Now a wolf flies from him as he wanders unarmed in the
woods near his Sabine farm.

We may compare the Ode with the Epistle (1. 10) addressed to
the same Fuscus, the motto of which may be said to be‘ Fuge
magna? v. 32. ‘A harmless, pious life is the true secret of safety
and of happiness '-the Ode dresses this doctrine in the garb of
poetry and religion— the Epistle in that of philosophy and worldly
wisdom. Aristius Fuscus is an intimate friend of Horace, Epp. 1.
