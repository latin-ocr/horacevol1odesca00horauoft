EPODE XVI, 1-28

detestata,’ seems conclusive in favour of the simpler meaning.
Compare the common epithet, ‘ dirus Hannibal.’

9. devoti sanguinis, the descriptive genitive, Madv. ξ 287. The
thought is the same as that of Epod. 7. ‘ There is a curse on this
generation. They draw their crimes with their blood from their
predecessors.’

10. rursus, ‘as before the city was built.’

13. ossa Quirini. Porph. quotes Varro as saying that there
was a tomb of Romulus ‘post Rostra ’ (‘ pro Rostris‚’ Comm. Cruq.).
And Orelli refers to this a corrupt and obscure fragment of Festus,
‘niger lapis in Comitio locum funestum significat ut ali (ἒ) Romuli
morti destinatum.' Horace ignores the legend of his apotheosis
which he adopts in Od. 3. 3. 16 foll. ‘ Martis equis Acheronta fugit.’

14. nefas videre, ‘ sight of shame’ ; Virg. Aen. 8. 688 ‘ sequitur-
que nefas Aegyptia coniunx’; the infinitive for the more usual
supine ‘mirabile dictu.' Grammatically, ‘nefas’ is an accusative
characterizing the action of the ‘ dissipabit ossa.’

15, 16. ‘May be, with one voice, or, at least, the better part of
you, you, are asking what can help you to get quit of your sad
troubleS.

h 15.f melior, explained by v. 37, ‘the teachable, the manly‚ the
ope ul.'

16. carere = ‘ad carendum.’ Bentley, after Rutgers‚ objecting
to the ambiguity of ‘ quid expediat carere? ’ which might also mean
‘what is the good of getting quit?' would read ‘quod expediat,’
taking it as equivalent to ‘ quod bene vortat,’ ‘ quod felix faustumque
sit.’ The reading has since been found in two MSS. of the tenth
century σ and τ.

17. hac, sc. ‘ ire‚’ &c.‚ v. 21.

Phocaeorum, Herod. 1. 165.

18. exsecrata, ‘ having sworn an oath of imprecation.’ It is used
with the accusative ‘haec,’ in ν. 25. ποιησαμένη ἰσχυρὰς κατάρας,
Hdt. l. c. The construction is ‘profugit agros atque Lares . . . reli·
quitque fana habitanda apris,' ἃς.

21, 22. ‘To fly either by land or sea.’ Cp. Od. 3. 11. 49 ‘ I pedes
quo te rapiunt et aurae.’

23. eie placet? ‘are you so agreed ? ’ ‘ Placetne ? ⁹ was the usual
form, as Bentley remarked, of asking the assent of the senate or
andy public body. Horace varies the form, as is his way; see on
O . 3. 5. 42.

secunda alite, ‘in a happy hour’; ‘silentium contionis pro
assensu accipit,’ Ritter. He answers that the omens are favourable.
⁴ Let us start at once while we may.'

25. ‘So soon as stones shall rise from the water's bottom and
float to the surface, be it no sin to come back again,’ i.e. then
and no sooner.

28. 29. ‘ Not till the geographical relation of places is altered3
till the Po washes the hills of Apulia, till the Apennines, which run
down the middle of Italy, push their chain out into the sea.’
