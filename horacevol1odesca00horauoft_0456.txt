THE ODES OF HORACE

²9· virtute functos, ‘who have lived their lives like men?
Horace adapts the use of ‘ functus vita‚' ‘functus laboribus‚’ ‘ whose
labours are over,’ 2. 18. 38, of the dead, substituting a character of
the life and its employments. Compare the prose expression in
Cic. Tusc. 1. 45. 109 ‘nemo parum diu vixit qui virtutis perfecto
functus est munere.’

more patrum, with ‘ canemus! Cicero twice (Tusc. 1. 2. 3 and 4.
2. 3) quotes the authority of Cato's ‘ Origines ’ for such a custom in
earlier generations ε ‘ solitos in epulis canere convivas ad tibicinem
de clarorum virorum virtutibus.’

30. Lydis. Possibly only a poetical epithet helping ‘more
patrum,' by suggesting the antiquity of the instrument; but in
Epod. 9. 6 Horace seems to lay emphasis on a distinction of the
Dorian and Phrygian modes, so that here he may designedly speak
of the Lydian as the one most suitable for this occasion. In that
case it may harmonize with the ‘iocosi munera Liberi,' being
classed by Plato (Rep. 3, p. 398) as one of the μαλακαὶ καὶ ξυμποτικαὶ
ἁ ovim.

pssemixtm A. P. 151. The word is only found besides in two
passages of Seneca.

32. progeniem Veneris ; cp. C. S. 50 ‘Clarus Anchisae Veneris·
que sanguis.' So that their topics correspond to those of Od. 1. 12

(cp. 1. 12. 13 with v. 28 of this Ode): the gods, the heroes of

Roman story, the Julian house, and Augustus its crowning glory.
