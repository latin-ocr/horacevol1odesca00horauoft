THE ODES OF HORACE

Vulteius over Philippus' wine, ‘dicenda tacenda locutus? Epp.1

7. 72. The wording is apparently from the verse of Simonides
(ξ 66)” εστι καὶ σιγᾶς ἀκίνδυνον γέρας, which Plutarch (Apophth. Reg-
et Imp. ., Aug. 7) mentions Augustus as quoting. The mysteries of
Ceres are used merely as an illustration.

27- 30. Cp. Aesch. S. e. T. 602 foll. H ’,γὰρ ξυνεισβὰς πλοῖον εὐσεβὴς
ἀνὴρ Ι ναύταισι θερμοῖς καὶ πανουργιᾳ τινὶ Ι ὄλωλεν ἀνδρῶν σὺν θεοπτυστῳ
γένει, and the same idea in Soph. Ant. 372, Eur. El. 1354, Xen.
C rop. 8. 1. 9.

y29. Diespiter, see on 1. 34. 5. The archaic name is said to be
specially appropriate here as having been used 1n solemn formulae,
as when Ζεὺς ὅρκιος was called to witness treaties or vows.

30. incesto, 1. 12. 59‘ parum castis? Carm. S. 42 ‘,'castus of
impurity contracted whether by ceremonial or moral faults.

32. deseruit, ‘has given up the pursuitss

pede claudo. Retribution is ὑστερόποινος, ὑστεροφθόρος, in the
Greek poets. Her ‘halting foot' seems to be Horace' 5 own3

possibly he had in his eyes Homer’s description of the λιταί who Ὗ

limp after the steps οΓΆτ-η, 11. 9. 503.

ODE 111

‘ De Iustitia et Constantia? Firmness os purpose is characterized
in vv. 1-8. It is the virtue by which Pollux and Hercules, and
Augustus and Bacchus, rose to heaven, by which Romulus overcame
the opposition of Juno, and won immortality for himself and world-
wide empire for Rome. justice is not absent from the early stanzas
of the Ode, for it is a just as well as a firm purpose which is
glorified in them; but it is the keynote of Juno’s speech, vv. 18-68.
She yields to the persevering purpose of Romulus and of Rome.
Her wrath was against the ‘periura Priami domus,’ the ‘unjust
judge,' v. 19, the promise-breaker, v. 22, the violator of the laws
of hospitality and of marriage, v. 25. They have been punished',
and she is satisfied. As long as beasts of the field hide their whelps
on the tombs of Priam and Paris, the Capitol may stand in its -
glory. Rome may extend her sway over the world, only let her
leave gold in the mine, send her citizens to the world's end in
search gof empire, not of treasure. And let her beware above all
things of the dream of rebuilding the doomed city of Troy. Troy

rebtlllisst ,fiJutno’ s wrath will revive, and the second falyl shall be as bad
as e rs

For the meaning of this last warning see additional note onp ..151

Several MSS„ including V and A (B omits the Odes 2· -‚6) pwrote
this Ode continiiously with the Second, and Porphyrion, noticing
the question, decides that they‘ manifeste cohaerent?
