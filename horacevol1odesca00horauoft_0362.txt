2. potior, a preferred rival, as in Epod. 15. 13.

4. Persarum rege3 2. 12. 21. Cic. Tusc. 5. 12. 35 ‘ne de
Persarum quidem rege magno potes dicere beatusne sit.' That 15
from Plat. Gorg. 26. 470, but a comparison of 2. 2. 17 will show
that, though the‘ happiness’ of a ‘Persian king’ is proverbial, and
Greek rather than Latin, yet Horace so completely identifies
Persians and Parthians, that he would hardly have understood his

commentators when they say that‘he is referring here, not to the·

Parthians, but to the old Persian monarchy.

5. alia arsisti3 2. 4. 8‘ arsit virgine!

7. multi Lydia nomime, not as though literally the world knew
her name3 but she felt as proud of his preference as if she had
a fam·e§equal to that of Ilia. For the genitive‘ nominis’ see
Madv 287

8. Romana, the ancestress of Rome (as the mother of Romulus,
according to one form of the legend3 cp.1.2. 17). The epithet
indicates the source and the extent of her fame.

10. citharae seiens; 1. 15. 24 ‘ pugnae sciens. ‘

12. animae, ‘her life! It has 315 o been taken for‘ my life,’ i. e.
Chloe. cp. ‘meae partem animae,’2. 17. 5and 1. 3. 8.

14. Thurini filius Ornyti3 see Introd. to 2. 4. The fullness of
the designation is probably, as Ritter points out, as much as to
say, ‘'He 15 3 1531 person. Ι can tell you all about him if you wish‚

as well as you can tell me of Chloe and her charms.’ Cp. 3. 12. 6. '

Thurii seems to be selected for its old reputation of wealth and
luxury; the others are mythological names, chosen ‘ut poetica et
sonora‚’ Orelli. ‘ Ornytus’ is used by Virg. Aen. 11. 677.

16. puero. It is not quite easy to see the point of Lydia’s
variation from ‘animae’ It may be merely for variety's sake.
Possibly‚ however, ‘animae,’ taken in connexion with the early
lines of the stanza, which had not touched a very deep chord,
might have seemed conventional, and have provoked the simpler
and more personal, and so more feeling ⁴ puero.'

18. iugo aeneo, 1. 33. 11, of its strength; ‘irrupta copula,’
1.1318.

cogit, ‘brings together! Virg. Aen. 7. 639 has ‘ad iuga cogit
e uos?
q19. excutitur, is dislodged from her influence over my heart.
Virg. Aen. 5. 679‘ excussaque pectore Iuno est' or, as Bentley
