THE ODES OF HORACE

Vario, L. Varius Rufus, the friend of Horace and Virgil‚ and one
of the literary executors of the latter. Cp. Sat. 1. 5. 40, 1. 6. 55, 1.
9. 23, 1. 10. 44, 81, 2. 8. 21, 63, Epp. 2. 1. 247, A. P. 55.

2. Maeonii, Od. 4. 9. 5, ‘ Homeric ’ ; cp. Sat. 1. 10. 44 ‘ Forte epos
acer Ut nemo Varius ducit.'

alite is the unanimous reading of the MSS., and the Schol. found
it, for the difficulty of the abl. made them separate it from ‘Vario ’
and explain it by ⁵ Homericis auspiciis.’ Must it be altered to ‘ aliti ’ἓ
The change is easy, too much so to be probable. lt seems impos-
sible to explain it as a rare instance of an abl„ without the preposi-
tion, of the agent. It goes beyond all the cases quoted to parallel
it. There is in thern always either a predicate present as in ‘Iudice
laudatus Caesare,’ Sat. 2. 1. 84, ‘curatus inaequali tonsore‚’ Epp.
1. 1. 94, which brings them within the scope of the abl. absol„ or
the relation of the abl. to the verb is instrumenta] or modal rather
than persona] (see Drager, Hist. Synt. 1. § 229) as in ‘uxore con-
strictus,' Cic. Mil. 20. 54 ; ‘ Plato delectatus Dione,' Nep. 10. 2. 33
‘ matrum celebrabere turba,’ Ov. Met. 7. 50. The only alternative
seems to be to take ‘Vario . . . alite ’ with Orelli as an abl. absol„
a construction the use of which Horace is inclined to extend (see
Od. 2. 1. 12, 16, 2. 7. 15, 3. 5. 5). f The position of the words though
unusual has a certain force3 the promise or permission standing
first, and accompanied only by Varius' name as a sufficient guarantee
to stay in initio any impatience3 then, measured off against each
other, the characteristics of the theme and of the poet who is fit to
sing of it. ‘ It shall be told, but by VariuS, thy bravery and thy
victories‚ for he is a bird of Maeonian song.’ For ‘ales' as the
tiltle ot} eci) poet, cp. Od. 4. 2. 25 ‘ Dircaeum cycnum,’ and the whole
i ea o d. 2. 20.

3. quam rem eumque, ‘ every exploit which thy brave soldiery
achieved by sea or land, led on by thee’; the construction is as if
the previous clause had run ‘ scribentur fortitudo et victoriae tuae!
The tmesis is common in Horace, cp. Od. 1. 7. 25, and even in
prose, Cic. pro Sest. 31. 68 ‘ quod iudicium cumque subierat.’

5. nos, so v. 17. It is an emphatic form of the ‘ plural of modesty'
(Drager, Hist. Syntax, 1. ξ 9) which avoids, in speaking of one's
own performance, the definitely personal ‘1'3 this also suggests
a class, ⁴1 and such as I,’ ‘ people of my level ’ς cp. Od. 2. 17. 32.
Q nequedd . neo, ‘ we essay no more to tell this tale than to tell,’
c C.‚ cp. . 3. 5. 27.

6. stomachum. This rendering of the Homeric μῆνιν οὐλομένην
is quoted by Charisius as an instance of intentional ταπείνωσις,
which he defines ‘rei magnae humilis expositio,’ as if it were an

undignified word chosen to show Horace's distaste for such a char· ‘¹

aeter. In any case, in respect of this as well as of ‘ duplicis' and
‘ saevam,’ though the traits themselves are traditiona1‚ their selec-
tion is probably intended to point a contrast with the milder themes
which Horace prefers. ‘I cannot write of the fierceness and the
craft and the cruelty of heroic wars.’
