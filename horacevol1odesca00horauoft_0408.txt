THE ODES OF HORACE

of what is internal, and so his own. The expression is parallel
to Plato's ἀρετὴν ἀντὶ ἱματίων ἀμφιέσονται of the women of his‘state,
Rep. 5. p. 457 A. .

56. quaero, seek as my bnde.

58. miseram Juv. 3. 276 ‘ votum miserabile.’

59. decurrere3 Virg. Aen. 5. 782 ‘ preces descendere ad omnis,’
Hdt. 1. 116 καταβαίνειν εἷς λιτάς.

62. biremis, not a ship with two banks of oars, but=‘duorum
scalmorum navicula,’ Cic. ad Att. 10. 10. 5, a little two-oared boat
attached to a larger vessel. The two stanzas are metaphorical.
‘ If my fortune fails me, I am not like the merchant who in a ship-
wreck wastes his time in abject prayers for his cargo3 1 can get
ashore with all 1 care for?

64. geminus Pollux. ‘ Pollux, the twin-brother,' is as much as
to say, ‘ Pollux, with his twin-brother Castor? Cp. 1. 3. 2, 1. 12. 25,

4. 323¹·

ODE XXX

⁴ THE task is done; the monument is built which will immortalize
my name. While Rome stands men will tell how one born by the
Aufidus rose from a humble rank to greatness: the first Roman
lyric poet. Melpomene, give me the crown which 1 have earned.'

Cp. Od. 1. 1 and 2. 20 and notice the growth of poetic self-

confidence in the three Odes. The Ode is paraphrased by Ovid, Α,

Met. 15. 871 foll.
· Metre—First A sclepiad.

1. exegi, ‘ finished?

. aere = ‘aereis statuis.’

2. situ, ‘ construction,’ an unusual sense of the word, as it is
generally used of the site of a building, not of its erection. Dillr.
quotes T ac. Ann. 3. 38 ‘ Philippopolim a Macedone Philippo sitam?

3. impotens, of unrestrained violence. Cp. Epod. 16. 62 ‘ impo-
tentia astri,’ Od. 1. 37. 10. ,

5. fuga3 cp. 2. 1. 41, and see on 2. 5. 13. Ritter points out that
there is the suggestion of a double metaphor of the destructive
effects of time, ‘si quidem memoria annorum aut annorum serie
obruitur aut fuga temporum abripitur.’

6. multa, as Ovid in the same connexion‚’ ‘ parte . . . meliore mei.’

que3 see on 1. 27. 16.

7. Libitinam3 Sat. 2. 6. 19, Epp. 2. 1. 49. Not merely ‘death,’
but ‘the funeral rites.’ Cp. Od. 2. 20. 21 foll.

8. crescam laude, as ‘ secundis laboribus crevit,’ 4. 4. 45.

reeens, ‘ ever fresh‚’ not half-forgotten. Epp. 2. 1. 53 ‘ Naevius
in manibus non est et mentibus haeret Paene recens ?’

dum Capitolium, &c., ‘ as long as Rome stands‚’ which to
a Roman is as much as to say ‘ for ever! The ‘ virgo ’ is doubtless
