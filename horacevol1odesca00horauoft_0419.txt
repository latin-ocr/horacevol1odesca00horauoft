ODE IV

‘ LIKE a young eagle that leaves the nest, tries his wings, then
swoops down, first on sheep—folds, but soon on more dangerous
foes;—like a young lion to the eyes of the unsuspecting hind, who
is to be the first victim of his unfleshed tooth ;—such has Drusus .
been in his campaign in Vindelicia÷noble by inherited excellence,
noble also by his royal rearing. Rome’s gratitude to the house of
the N eros is summed up in the memory of Metaurus, the turning-
point of the terrible Punic War, when Hasdrubal was routed‚ and
the traces of war vanished, and Hannibal himself bore witness to
Rome’s vitality. “It is madness for us to pursue our enemy; more
than enough if we can escape their pursuit. From the fires of their
native Troy, from the hardships of the long voyage to Italy, they
have but drawn strength and stubbornness‚ like the oak on Algidus
which the woodman lops, or the hydra ever growing again to baffle
the patience of Hercules. All hope is gone for ever, and buried
with Hasdrubal.'' And the conqueror was an ancestor of the N eros.
Jupiter protects the race, and Augustus directs their campaigns.
What may we not expect from their arms ? ’

brothers. In Β. C. 16, when Augustus set out for Gaul, taking with
him Tiberius, who was praetor at the time, Drusus was appointed
