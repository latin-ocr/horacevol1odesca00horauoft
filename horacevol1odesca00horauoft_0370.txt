THE ODES OF HORACE

from an affectionate memory of the Bandusian spring, such as he
elsewhere shows of M ount Vultur, the nestling village of Acheruntia,

- and other spots near the home of his boyhood; or, if ‘cras dona-

beris’ seems too definite for a mere address of fancy, we must
conclude that at some period of his life he revisited Venusia. The
fact, however, that he does not himself indicate the-locality of the
‘ Fons Bandusiae ² may have caused topographers to make various
guesses in early times as well as late, and the Venusian claimant of
the name need not be the genuine one. Verses 2-8 are probably
interpreted of the Fontanalia, a festival on Oct. 12, named by
Varro, Ling. Lat. 5, ‘ in fontis coronas iaciunt et puteos coronant!

Metre—Ffilt Asclepiad.

1. vitro, Virg. Aen. 7. 759 ‘vitrea Fucinus unda?

2. mero, floribus, haedo. These seem to be three distinct
offerings. For the flowers see the account of the Fontanalia quoted
above. For the wine and the sacrifice cp. Ov. Fast. 3. 300 foll.
‘ Huc venit et fonti rex Numa mactat ovem, Plenaque odorati
disponit pocula Bacchi.’

4. eui frons, &c., cp. 3. 22. 7 foll„ 4. 2. 55 foll. Here the
immediate purpose is to describe the age of the kid. Granted that
a deity (and the spring is divinized) desired a sacrifice, he would
be pleased by the details of the promised ceremony as well as by
its ritual exactness. Perhaps we may add that as the victim was
aster all for the eating, not of gods, but of men, the religious
ceremony being not much more than a ‘grace before meat,' the
offerer would take an interest in the delicacy of the offering, and
would moralize with more complacency on the irony of its fate.

5. destinat, ‘ promises,' ‘points to?

6. frustra: nam, cp. 3. 7. 21.

6, 7. gelidos, rubro, a double antithesis is intended, Horace, after
his manner (see on 2. 3. 9, 3. 4. 46, 4. 4. 10), indicating the contrast
in each case by putting an epithet to only one of the two substan-
tives, ‘the cold [clear] stream‚' ‘the [warm] red blood.’

9. hora, ‘ season,’ as A. P. 302 ‘ sub verni temporis horam.'

Caniculae, the name given by the Romans to Sirius, the brightest
star in the constellation of the ‘ Great Dog.’ On the history of the
term ‘dies Caniculares‚’ our ‘ dog days,' see Smith's Dict. Ant. s. v.
‘ Astronomia.’ ⁴

12. vago, tired with wandering.

13. fies fontium, ‘thou shalt become one of‚’ ‘shalt take rank
with’ Dirce, Castalia, Arethusa, ὅτε. For the partitive genitive
with the verb cp. Sat. 1. 7. 35 ‘operum hoc, mihi crede, tuorum
est,' Epp. 1. 9. 13 ‘Scribe tui gregis hunc‚’ and see Madv. L. G.
§284‚ obs. 2. He quotes Cic. pro Caec. 35. 102 ‘ Ariminenses erant
duodecim coloniarum,’ ‘ were one of the twelve coloniae.‘

14-17. me...t.uae. In the emphatic places. Thou shalt be
famous, for my songs can confer fame.

15. loquaces, with ‘ desiliunt,' they babble as they leap down.
