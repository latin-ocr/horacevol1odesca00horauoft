ODE VIII

‘UNDER other circumstances, Censorinus, I would send my
friends bronzes and pictures‚ and you should have the best of them.
As it is I have none to give, and you would not care for them.
Verse you will value and verse I can give; and hear now the value
1 set on the gift. Statues and inscriptions, the great feats of the
Punic wars, do not throw such lustre on generals like the Scipios,
as do the verses of Ennius. Would father Romulus nave lived
without a grateful posterity to tell of him? Would Aeacus have
won the happy islands but for Pindar's Muse? The Muse gives
immortality, and instals her favourites in a place in heaven; witness
HerculeS, the Tyndaridae, Bacchus himself!

C. Marcius Censorinus was consul in B.C. 8, and died, amid
general regret, A. D. 2. Vell. Paterculus calls him ⁴ vir demerendis
hominibus natus.’

1. donarem. This reference is to the custom of exchanging
presents (‘ strenae ⁹) on certain occasions, such as the Calends of
March or the Saturnalia. Cp. the Pseudo-Tibull. 3. 1. 1 ‘ Martis
Romani festae venere Kalendae . . . Et vaga nunc certa discurrunt
undique pompa Perque vias urbis munera perque domos‚’ and read
Stat. Silv. 4. 9. The condition to ‘ donarem ’ must be understood
from the protasis of the'following sentence ‘ divite me,’ &c., although
the construction there has been changed and we are speaking no
longer of bronzes but of pictures and sculpture, but it is helped also
by the words ‘grata commodus‚’ which answer to one another,
‘grata ⁹ meaning ‘ pleasing to their taste,’ ‘ commodus ' (cp. 3. 19.
12, Epp. 2. 1. 227, A. P. 257) ‘consulting their taste.’ ‘1 would
give . . . if I had thern, and my friends cared for them!

2. aera, works in bronze, such as vases.

3. fortium Graiorum, in reference to such passages as Hom.
11. 23. 259, 264, &c. (cp. Virg. Aen. 5. 110, 9. 265), and to the use
of a tripod as a prize at the Pythian and other games; Herod. 1.
144.

E 5. ferres, ‘ acciperes,' se. ‘a me '; Od. 3. 16. 22, Sat. 2. 1. 12,

p . 2. 2. 14.

sssffioet emphasizes the condition, the stubbornness of the ‘ if.'
‘All this would happen, supposing, you mark me, I were rich,' διε.

artium, ‘ works of art ’ ; Epp. 1. 6. 17, 2. 1. 203. It goes sorne-
what beyond Virgil‘s use, ‘ clipeum . . . Didymaonis artis,' Aen. 5.
359, which is after such expressions as Soph. O. C. 472 κρατῆρες . . .
ἀνδρὸς εὔχειρος τέχνη.

6. Parrhasius, a painter of Ephesus, a contemporary of Zeuxis,
and therefore living about the time of the Peloponnesian war.
Xenophon describes Socrates as paying a visit to his studio. Qum-
