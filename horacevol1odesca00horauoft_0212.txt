THE ODES OF HORACE

17.l sapiens, ‘be wise and remember,' δία, Od. 1. 11. 6 ‘sapias, 'j
vina iques.

19. molli, ‘’mellow, as ‘lene‚’ Od. 3. 29. 2. It breaks the flow
of the ‘sentence needlessly to take ‘molli,' with Ritter, as an
lmperatlve.

20. tenent. .tenebit,‘ as now,’ ‘as by and by,' stress is clearly
laid on the tenseS, so th'at apparently Plancus was now, or might
be supposed to be, campaigning.

21 foll. The story of Teucer' s ill reception by his father Telamon
when he returned without Ajax, and of his founding a new Salamis
in Cyprus, was the subject, no doubt, of the ‘ Teucer’ of Sophocles,
of which one or two fragments remain. It is also the subject ot
allusions in other writers, as in Pind. Nem. 4. 73. The ‘ Teucer ⁹ of
Pacuvius was specially admired by Cicero (de Or. Ι. 57. 246) and

the words attributed to Teucer in Tusc. 5. 37. 108 (ε ad omnem -

rationem Teucri vox accommodari potest: Patria est ubicumque
est bene ') no doubt came from just such a speech to his companions
as Horace ls here imagining.

22. cum fugeret, when he was starting on his banishment.

23. populea, sacred to Hercules, to whom as a wanderer Teucer

would offer sacrifice3‘ vagus Hercules‚' Od. 3. 3. 9. Orelli quotes
Xenophon, Anab. 6. 2. 9, who speaks of sacrificing τῷ ἡγεμόνι
‘.Hpa1<)xe'i

27. duce et auspice, ‘under Teucer's conduct and Teucer’s
star,' a curious technicality of Roman military life to put into Teucer’s
mouth: ‘ductu et auspicio,’ Liv. 6. 123 ‘domuit partim ductu
partim auspiciis suis Cantabriam‚' &C.‚ Suet. Oct. 21. The two did

not necessarily belong to the same person. The auspices were 1
taken in the name of the imperator, and the ‘ felicitas ’ was his, see

Od. 4. 14. 33 foll. Horace has not exactly reproduced the technical
phrase, for we find ‘auspiciis Camilli, Augusti,' &c.‚ not ‘auspice
Camillo.' ‘Auspex' is used elsewhere either of the person who

attends the imperator and actually takes the auspiceS‚·or if in the ’

sense of ‘ patron,’ then only of some god who by omens or other-
wise sanctions an enterprise; see Epp. 1. 3. 13‘ auspice Musa',
but Keller has pointed to Lucan'‘s contentique auspice Bruto‚’ 2.
371. Meanwhile a certain amount of doubt hangs over the reading. ,
‘Teucri' has better MSS. support than ‘Teucro.’ The genitive
should be taken with ‘ futuram.’ Others, however, punctuate after,
and not, as in the text, before ‘Teucri.’ With this latter punctua-
tion two interpretations are possible: (1) ‘under the guidance of
Teucer and Teucer’s patron,' sc. Apollo—a rendering which derives
support from Acron’s note, ‘auspica F autore vel suasore, Apolli-
nem dicit cuius responsa vel promissa sequebatur’; (2) ‘while
Teucer is Teucer’s guide and patron.' N either interpretation can
be called satisfactory. (Bentley reads ex coni. ‘Phoebo‚’ which
would satisfy Acron’s note, though not so probably as ‘Teucri ².)
‘ Teucro,’ which is found in a number of good MSS„ has the look
of an ‘emendation.’ If it be accepted as the true reading, it seems
