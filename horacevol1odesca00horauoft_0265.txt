9-11. See on Od. 3. 4. 45. The meaning is ‘all creation.’ The

⁷ conical cap worn at Rome by the ‘ flamines' ; see Virg. Aen. 8. 664,

and Conington’s note on id. 2. 683. Cicero (Leg. 1. 1) uses it
where Livy (1. 34) uses ‘pileus,’ in telling the story of the eagle

. which snatched away and restored the cap of Tarquinius Priscus

as he approached Rome. It seems quite possible (as Lord Lytton

ἑ argues) that even if Horace is actually thinking of the vicissitudes
12³ of Phraates, he may be also ‘ borrowing a metaphor to describe
vJ them from a familiar Roman myth.’

‘deus’ as an expression of the power that governs human life. It

is only (as in Od. 3. 29. 49 foll. where also we have her‘ rushing
wings’) the personificatiOn of the vicissitudes of life, the effect

that we see, not the cause which he has traced 1n the lines before.

ODE XXXV

THE Fortuna of this Ode, as has been already suggested, is

, a different conception from t’hat of the last. She is the author
η of the vicissitudes of life, but not in sport (as in Od. 3. 29. 49), or
' at random as the blind chance· -goddess. The apparent capricious-
2 ness is that of a hidden will, and its decisions have the fixity of

fate. Through any confusion of image in vv. 21— —28 (see on v 24)
the thought is clear, that her attributes are moral. ‘Her frown
does not drive away hope nor extinguish any but mercenary
affection! Her purposes are moral, and the greatness of Rome is
amongst them.

The purpose of the Ode seems to lie in the last three stanzas.

· Fortune the mistress of human life, so universal in her sway, so
