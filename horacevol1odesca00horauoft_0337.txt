BOOK III, ODE ΙΙΙ, 14-40

28. rest-ingit, breaks their onset, turns. ‘ Danai . . . decimum
quos distulit Hector in annum} Virg. Aen. 9. 154.

29. ductum, as ‘trahere bellum,’ Sall. Jug. 643 ‘ prolonged by
our quarrels,' ‘ seditio ' in the sense of στάσις.

30. protinus, ‘this moment, and from henceforth.'

31. nepotem, Romulus is the grandson of Juno as the son of
Mars; his birth is a fresh grievance besides the ‘graves irae'
against his Trojan ancestry.

32. Juno will not name Rea Silvia ; see on vv. 19, 20. There is
probably additional scorn in the close conjunction of ‘peperit
sacerdos' (==‘a vestal‚' as in Virg. Aen. 1. 273 ‘regina sacerdos
Marte gravis ²), and in the epithet ‘Troica‚' as if it meant not
merely ‘of Trojan blood‚' but ‘a true Trojan.’

33. Marti occupies the place of emphasis as stating in one word
the consideration which induces her to forego the resentment
which had such full grounds. Compare the balancing of the
sentence in 2. 8. 1—5 with note.

redonabo, a word only found in Horace, Od. 2. 7. 3. It is here
used in the same sense as ‘ condonare ' in Caesar, Bell. Gall. 1. 20
‘ Dumnorigem Divitiaco fratri se condonare dicit,’ i. e. ‘ Dumnorigi
ignoscere propter fratrem.'

illum ego, both words emphatic. It would not be strange that
any other of the gods should consent to the admission os Romulus,
nor that Juno should consent to the admission of any but one of
that hateful parentage.

34. ducere, the variation of reading between ‘ducere ' and
‘discere' is as old as Acr. and Porph.‚ the former of whom
interprets ‘ propinare—potare‚' the latter ‘assuescere saporibus
nectaris.’ ‘Ducere' is the simpler; it is a common Horatian
word, as with ‘ pocula‚' Od. 1. 17. 22, ‘ Liberum‚’ 4. 12. 14, &c.

3 5. adscribi ordinibus, ‘ adscribi in civitatem': so ‘ civitatibus,’
Cic. pro Arch. 4. 6, 7, ‘ urbanae militiae,' Tac. Hist. 2. 94. It may
be doubted how far any distinct metaphor is felt in ‘ordinibus,'
whether a muster-roll, or the seats of the Council-hall.

quietis, a touch of the Epicurean doctrine of Sat. 1. 5. 101 ; cp.
‘ ea cura quietos sollicitat‚' Virg. Aen. 4. 379.

37. longus, saeviat, imply that the sea which flows between
them must be ‘ dissociabilis!

38. exsules, the banished Τ rojans, and provided they do not
break their banishment. ‘Dictum-sane videtur curn leni quadam
despicientia,’ Orell. The emphasis is really on the one thing that
she cares for, viz. that Troy and Troy's manners should have an
end. This is brought out equally by the half contemptuous way in
which she speaks of the fate of the ‘exiles ' in comparison with that
of their old home, and by the grandeur of the destiny which she is
willing to allow them if this one proviso is attended to.

40. Priami . . . busto. The commentators remind us that
accofding to Virgil, Aen. 2. 567, Priam did not actually receive
sepu ture.
