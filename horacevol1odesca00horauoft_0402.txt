THE ODES OF HORACE

Oreum moror, ‘keep Death waiting’

51. 51 quis audis. The second person of the verb is used by
a kind of attraction, something between‘ O dii, si auditis‚’ and
‘O deus, si quis deorum audit? Dill. cpmpares 'Virg. Aen. 4. 684
‘ Exoriare aliquis nostris ex ossibus ultor.’ ·

5 3.-56 The point of this stanza is not quite obvious. Orelli

thinks she dep recates a tedious death, ancl quotes Soph. Ant. ,

819 foll. ουτε φθΡινάσιν πληγεῖσα νόσοις Ι οὔτε ξιφέων’ επίχειρα λαχοῦσᾏ l
ἀλλ’ αὐτόνομος <ctum μόνη δὴ Ι θνατῶν Ἀΐδαν καταβήσει. But probably
the thought is rather that she would make haste and let her young
beauty, the hated cause of her present condition, gain her a death
before it too vanished. It may at least be of some use if it makes

her a dainty morsel for a tiger. She loathes her beauty : it is not ,

that she would spare it from withering, or herself. from seeing it
wither.

58. hae ab orno, ‘ you need not look far!

59. bene = ‘ opportune ’ ; cp. Aesch. Suppl. 457 foll.

60. laedere, ‘to break’; more usually ‘elidere,' a conscious v
μείωσις. Cp. Soph. Ant. 54 πλεκταῖσιν ἀρτάναισι λωβᾶται βίον. Itis
a common mode of self- destruction in the heroic legends. Cp.
Jocasta (Ant. l. c.,) and Antigone herself, ib. 1221 τὴν μὲν κρεμαστὴν
αὐχένος κατείδομεν, Ι βρόχῳ μιτώδει σινδόνος (=‘ zona ’) καθημμένην.

61. leto, the dative of the purpose with respect to which they are
sharp. Di'llr. points out the bitterness of‘ delectant.' The only

reason the father for the moment can imagine why she should not ·

hang herself, is that she is caught by the charms of some other
form of death.

62. procellae. The idea seems to be that she is to trust herself <

to the wings of the wind, which will carry her quickly to⁴ the bottom.

64. carpere pensum3 Prop. 3. 6. 15 ‘ tristes sua pensa ministrae
Carpebant, medio nebat et ipsa loco,’ of maidens carding their.
‘weighed portions' of wool for the mistress to spin. ·

65. sanguim 2. 20. 6, 4. 2. 13, C. S. 49.

66. barbarae, ‘foreign,' as though a Greek, and not a Tyrian,
were talking. Cp. Conington on Virg. Aen. 2. 504. The ‘ paelex'
will be at the command of the native queen, as Cassandra at
Clytemnestra’ 5 in the Agam.

67. perfidum ridens; 1. 22. 23, 2. 12. 14, 2. 19. 6. Her‘ smile
of treachery’ is partly at the success of the device which has
beguiled Europa, partly (the emphasis being rather on ‘ridens,’
which comes to some extent παρὰ προσδοκίαν), with a more playful
meaning, at Europa' 5 misplaced grief, which she is about to allay. >
Cupid has his bow unstrung, to show that his work' 15 over.

69. abstineto irarum3 for the Greek gen. see on 2.9. 17.

71. oum reddet, i. e. presently, when he gives you the opportu-
nity of doing as you have said that you would do (v. 45).

73. uxor 5555 1155515. Either the Greek construction for

huxorem te esse nescis’3 or, as Orelli preferred, = ‘tamquam uxorem
te gerere nescis,’ ‘you know not how to play the wife.’
