THE ODES OF HORACE

sip Lesbian in the shade without the brawls of a city merrymaking
or the tipsy violence of Cyrus' love and Jealousy?

1. Lucretilem. This name probably covers the whole mass of
mountain between the Licenza valley and the Campagna—the high-
est point of which is now called Monte Gennaro. See map at the
beginning of vol. 2 and note on the site of Horace's villa, pp. 289 f.

2. mutat. It is more usual to put the thing taken in exchange
in the abl„ as in the last Ode, v. 26 ‘ mutare tristia mitibus’; but
Horace often inverts them as here and in Od. 3. 1. 47 ‘ Cur valle
permutem Sabina Divitias operosiores’; cp. Od. 2. 12. 21, Epod.
9. 27, Sat. 2. 7. 109. The abl. in either case is analogous to the
abl. of price, the transaction being regarded from the side, in
the first case, of the seller, in the second of the buyer.

Lycaeo Faunus. Horace identifies (see on Od. 2. 17. 28), the
Latin Faunus, the legendary son of Picus, and giver of oracles
(Virg. Aen. 7. 48, 81), the god of agriculture and cattle (Hor. Od. 3.
18), with the Arcadian Pan, ὀρειβάτης, the inventor of the pipe
(see v. 10). Cp. Ovid‚ Fast. 2. 267 foll„ and esp. v. 424 ‘ Faunus in
Arcadia templa Lycaeus habet.’ ‘ Lycaeus ’ is a mountain in Arcadia.

3. defendit, Virg. E. 7. 47 ‘Solstitium pecori defendite?

4. usque. The ‘frequent ' visits of Faunus have conferred ‘per-
petual ’ salubrity on Lucretilis.

5. tutum, pred, ‘without risk, for it is safe in his guardianship.'
Stress is laid on the quiet and security of the place; there are

the kids lilged, Virg. G. 3. 300 ‘ frondent’ia capris Arbuta sufficere.’

6. latentis . . . deviae. The two adj. are correlative, and so
really belong each to both clauses, The arbutus may be hidden in
a thicket of other shrubs, the thyme may grow only in nooks, but
the goats may stray safely to search for both.

7. uxores, Virg. E. 7. 7 ‘Vir gregis ipse caper’3 G. 3. 125
‘ pecori maritum.’

8. viridis, possibly with the idea that the colour indicated their
poisonous character. But any epithet makes a danger more terrible
which heffis our imagination to realize any of its circumstances
more νιν] y.

9. Martialis, an habitual epithet, as Virg. Aen. 9. 566 ‘ Martius
lupus’; but doubtless some correspondence is intended-between
the qualities of the wolves and the fierce god to whom they belong,
see on 1. 22. 13.

Haediliae. The oldest MSS. vary only between ‘haediliae’
and ‘haedilia.’ Acron read the latter, and interprets it ‘Septa
hedorum.’ But Bentley shows conclusively that even if the Romans
had used ‘ haedilia’ rather than ‘ caprilia’ (Varr. R. R. 2. 3. 8, as
they use ‘ovile‚’ not ‘agnile ')‚ it would be the plural of ‘haedile'
with the i long and the a short. Bentley himself defends the
suggestion of ‘haeduleae,’ ‘kids’ (Auratus had conj. ‘haedulei‚’
