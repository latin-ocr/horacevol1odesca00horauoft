EPODE IX, 4-22

11. 45 ‘Foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere saxo! Probably there
is a special emphasis of scorn on the foreign name as in Juvenal' s
‘ Rusticus illlle tuus sumit trechedipna‚ Quirine, Et ceromatico fert
niceteria co ο.’

17. ad huno frementee,‘ chafing at such a sigbt'3 ‘hunc’ =
‘militem spadonibus servientem? Compare perhaps the use of
‘hic' in Od. 3. 5. 37. For the construction we may perhaps quote
(with Bentley) Epp. 1. 19. 45 ‘Ad haec ego naribus uti Formido,’
though it is a stronger support to his own reading‘ ad hoc.' The
general meaning is well given by Porph.‘ [Gallorum] ideo mentio
facta est ut Romanos qui sub praepositis spadonibus aequo animo
militarent magis oneraret per comparationem Gallorum qui hoc
dedignati ad Caesarem se contulerunt? The sense is not altered,
while the construction is made simpler by Bentley’ s conjecture, ‘ad
h9c‚’ or Fea’‘s at hoc,’ adop ted by Orelli and Dillr. ; but the MSS.
give no encouragement to either. ‘ Ad hunc' is the reading which
has the best MS. authority, and it was interpreted by Acron. The
other readings with respectable authority are ‘ adhuc‚' which must
be taken with ‘ frementes,' ‘ up till this time neighing for the fight ’;
and ‘ at huc, ⁵ which was read by the Comm. Cruq„ and interpreted
by him ‘but to our side’ ; cp. Vell. 2. 84 ‘ Hinc ad Antonium nemo, ·
illinc ad Caesarem quotidie aliquid transfugiebat.'

18. Galli. These were Galatians, who with their princes
Deiotarus and Amyntas deserted to Octavianus shortly before the
engagement, Plut. Ant. 63.

canentes Caesarem, shouting his name as a war cry. The
Scholiasts, quote Virg. Aen. 7. 698 ‘ Ibant aequati numero regemque
canebant.

19, 20. These lines obviously describe some naval defection which
is matched with the desertion of the Galatian cavalry. It may be
noted that Plutarch (Ant. 63) follows his account of the defection of
the Galatians with the words τὸ δὲ ναυτικὸν ἐν παντι δυσπραγοῦν καὶ
πρὸς ἅπασαν ὑστερίζον βοήθειαν aveas ἠνάγκαζε τῷ πεζῶ προσέχειν τὸν
Ἀντώνιον. The meaning of ‘sinistrorsum citae’ has not been fully
explained. Bentley suggested that‘ puppim ciere, ’=‘ to put the
stern in motion,' may have been a Latin equivalent of πρύμναν
κρούεσθαι, ‘to back water‚’ and that ‘sinistrorsum-⁹ may have had
some technical meaning as a completion of the phrase. His second
explanation seems more likely, that Horace is speaking as one who
looks at the scene of war from the north, so that ‘to the left ’ would
mean ‘Jeastward i. e. back into the Ambracian Gulf. It 1s however

Δ one of the expressions which strongly suggest an eyewitneSS.

21. io Triumphe. ‘Triumphus’ is personified, as in Od. 4. 2.
49, see note there. There is an emphasis on tu‚’ ‘It must be the
'litiumplv {od himself that delays the starting of the procession, all
