GENERAL INTRODUCTION

THE TEXT, MSS„ SCHOLIASTS, EDITIONS.

ξ 1. THE text of Horace is one in which, if there are points which
must always remain in uncertainty, the uncertainty is of a bearable
kind. The worst result of a bad judgement will usually be only
to prefer the least probable of two readings, either of which has
something to say for itself, makes good sense, and has been
supported by great scholars.

The MSS. are numerous though not very ancient. There are

Ἰ none of the same authority as the uncial MSS. of Virgil. The

number is considerable of those which are placed between the

’· end of the ninth and the end of the tenth century: there is
'J one which by general consent is attributed to the ninth, and
’ there is testimony to the reading in many places of one no
. longer existent which may probably be placed in the same century.

We have (but in comparatively late MSS.) Scholia which in
their original form can ‘be traced with probability some to the

Τ fifth, some to the third century. Occasionally where doubt hangs
-ΞῙ, over the form of some salient expression in Horace we find light
ζ. thrown upon it by more or less certain imitations of it in Ovid or

in later Roman poets. Lastly, we have numerous quotations,

f, chiefly, in the grammatical writers of the first five centuries. These
J are rarely of any very high value3 partly because quotations are
· often made from memory1, partly because such quotations are
ἦ most commonly made to illustrate some metrical or grammatical
,μ point which is irrelevant to the difference of reading: there is
³ nothing therefore to prove that the text as it stands in the quotation
ξ, has not been adapted by a copyist to MSS. of the author as he

knew thern.
So far as externa] testimony goes, the evidence to which we

¹ Among slips of memory may probably be reckoned such readings as
‘intonsis’ (Quintilian) in Od. 1. 12. 41, ⁴ lactea' (Flavius Caper) in Od. 1.
13. 2, ‘Proteus' (Porphyrion) in Od. 1. 15. 5, and certainly ‘vulpecula'
(Servius) in Epp. 1. 3. 19.
