THE EPODES OF HORACE

23.1ugurthino bello, i. e. Marius. We notice that the two
triumphs which Horace compares with the triumph over Antony
arrd Cleopatra are over an African enemy. The danger escaped
now, he would suggest, is more odious and greater than those.

24. reportasti. ‘Reportare' is more commonly used with‘ prae-
dam’ or ‘victoriam,’ but Orelli quotes Cic. post Red. in Sen. 11. 28,
when speaking of his own return in terms of a triumph ‘equis
insignibus et curru aurato reportati.’

25. Africanum. The difficulties of these lines cannot be said to
be solved. For the reading, the MSS. are divided between ‘ Afri-
canum ’ and ‘ Africano? The Comm. Cruq. seems to have read the
latter. If (with Bentley, Orelli, Munro, Keller) we retain ‘Afri-
canum‚' which is more likely to have been altered by a copyist to
‘ AfricanO, ’ in order to harmonize with ‘ Iugurthino, ’ than vice versa,
the constr. is ‘neque A. reportasti parem ducem; ²· ‘sepulcrum’
must be taken in a metaph. sense, for‘ monumentum? Bentley
justifies this by the metaph. uses of τάφος, στήλη, μνῆμα, and by such
expressions as that of Statius Silv. 2. 7, who says that Lucan’ s poem
is to Pompey ‘ Pharo superba . . . altius sepulcrum.’ It cannot be
pretended that this is quite satisfactory. In all the cases quoted
there is something in the occasion or context which makes the
metaphor less abrupt than it is here. The change of construction
‘ nec Iugurthino bello . . . neque Africanum' is (as the alteration, if
so it be, to ‘ Africano' bears witness) rougher than we expect; and
after Africanus has been named, the rhetorical description of him
lacks evident point. Yet the alternatives (see additional note) have
at least equal difficulties m their way.

27. Punico, a less usual form of ίριιῐιί(;60.’ Either scarlet or
wihite was the proper colour of the‘ paludamentum,’ or general’s
c Oak.

28. sagum was the cloak of the common soldier on service, opp.
to ‘toga‚' the dress of a citizen; as understood with ‘Punico’ it
loses its special sense. For the construction of ‘ mutavit ’ with the
accusative of the thing taken, see on Od. 1. 17. 1.

29, 32. Three conjectures as to Antony’s flight. He is gone to
Crete or to Africa, or he 1s beating about on the sea. All these are
qualified by words to express his helpless state. If he wishes to go
to Crete he cannot command the winds: the Syrtes are ‘still vexed’
by the south wind: the sea drives him hither and thither.

31. petit governs ‘’Cretam as well as Syrtes.

33. capaciores, cp. Od. 2. 7. 21—23.

35. nauseam. The Schol. explain it by‘ quod multum vini et
dulce, ut est Lesbium, bibetur.' The editors till recently either
followed this or took it metaphorically of disgust, referring to vv. 1 1
soll. Since Biicheler' s suggestion < see introd. to the Epode) it has
been generally taken literally; Horace either is or imagines himself
at sea. In any case the coarse touch is probably intentional at the
end of an Epode.

36. metire,‘ mix in due proportions with water)
