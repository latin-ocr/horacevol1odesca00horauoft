THE ODES OF HORACE

4. 3.σύζυγε γνήσιε, Ον. Trist. 5. 2. 39 ‘Me miserum quid agam si ·

proxima quaeque relinquunt? Subtrahis effracto tu quoque colla
iugo.’ Sometimes, as Theoc. 12. 15 ἀλλήλους ἐφίλησαν ἴσῳ ζὺγῳ,
it only refers to the bond of love or friendship which is only easy
when both parties feel its weight equally.

29. ultimos, ‘remotis . . . Britannis‚’ Od. 4. 14. 47. Cp. Virg. E.
1. 67 ‘penitus toto divisos orbe Britannos'3 for the genitive ‘ orbis’
cp. ‘ Extremi hominum Morini‚’ Virg. Aen. 8. 727.

30. recens examen, Aesch. Pers. 126 πᾶς γὰρ ἱππηλάτας Ι καὶ
πεδοστιβὴς λεὼς Ι σμῆνος ὣς ἐκλέλοιπεν μελισ Ι σᾶν. Horace uses the*
metaphor of slaves clustering round the fire, Epod. 2. 65.

32. Oceano rubro, the Indian Ocean with its two armS, the
Persian Gulf and the Red Sea.

33. cicatricum et scelerie. The expression is of the nature of
what grammarians call hendiadys. In prose the ideas would be
grouped more logically. The real object of the feeling of ‘shame’
is one, viz. the ‘guilt’ of civil war; the ‘scars' are only its
memorials, the ‘brotherhood’ of the combatants its aggravation.
We are not ashamed of them in the same sense that we are
ashamed of the guilt; but the feeling of guilt comes to us through
divers approacheS. . ι . . ι

as ‘a fratribus occisorum,' is due partly to the fact just noticed ⁷
that the word is not intended to convey the full feeling; it is only
one approach among several 3—the thought of brothers is a shameful ,
thought to Romans, because they would think also how brothers
had been treated, as the thought of scars was shameful‚ because
they could not but remember the quarrel in which they had been
come by—partly to the fact that ‘fratrum’ as a correlative term
leads our thoughts to its correlative; of ‘ brothers’ conduct,' means
of their conduct as brothers, and so towards their brethren. Cp.
the pregnant use of ‘civis’ in Od. 1. 2. 21. Any more definite
expression of the horror of fratricidal war is purposely avoided
and sunk in the general question ‘ quid nos refugimus?’ With the
string of questions that follow, cp. Od. 2. 1. 29—36.

39. diffingas. The verb ‘ diffingere' is found in no other author,
and in Horace only here and in Od. 3. 29. 47 ‘neque Diffinget
infectumque reddet.' The Scholiasts interpret it here ‘ refabricare,’
‘reformare,' there ‘ immutare) It seems to mean ‘to make differ· ’
ently,' i. e. (in this case) ‘ to a different purpose.' The swords have
been blunted in civil war, they are to be beaten straight and sharp

Arabia, see Introd. to Od. 1. 29.
