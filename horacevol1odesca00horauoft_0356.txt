THE ODES OF HORACE

whom Orodes I in his grief at the death of Pacorus had resigned
the crown)‚ instigated Antony to his ill-advised invasion os Parthia
in B.C. 36. Before Antony’s advance Monaeses was induced by
Phraates to return to him, and Mommsen (R. G. Div. Aug. 5.
40-43) concludes that he was in command of the forces which
in the next months inflicted the defeat on Antony. He explains
therefore Horace’s ‘ bis' of the calamities of Β. C. 40 and 36.

10. non auspicatos is not an epithet‚ but predicative: it gives
the reason of the defeats and is the link with the last stanza. It
was especially mentioned of Crassus’ expedition that ‘ proficiscentem
in Syriam diris cum ominibus tribuni plebis frustra retinere conati,'
Vell. Pat. 2. 46.

13. paene, with ‘delevit.’ ⁴ While we were intent on our civil
wars the barbarians of north and south all but destroyed Rome‚’
a ”pogtical' exaggeration. For the Daci see Introd. to Books
1-111, 7.

14. Aethiops represents the Egyptian fleet of Cleopatra3 cp.
Virgil’s account of the rout at Actium, Aen. 8. 705 ‘omnis eo
tergore Aegyptus et Indi, Omnis Arabs, omnes vertebant terga
Sa aei.'

17. fecunda eulpae, for the gen. cp. ‘ferax frondis‚‘ 4. 4. 58.

saeou1a; it has been a gradual declension from age to age.

18. genus et domos, the young generation has vice in its blood,
and sees examples of vice in its homes.

20. patriam populumque. If any distinction is intended, it is
between the life and honour of the state as affected by defeat
in war, δια, and the well-being of its individual citizens.

33—36. The First Punic War, cp. 2. 12. 3 ⁴ Siculum mare Poeno
purpureum sanguine'; the war with Pyrrhus B.C. 275 ; that with
iglntiochus ended by the battle of Magnesia, B.C. 190 ; the Second

unic VVar.

35. ingentem, perhaps with reference to his cognomen ‘ M agnus.’

36. dirum, see on 2. 12. 2. '

37. ‘The manly sons of country-bred soldiers.' The fathers are
meant to have gone through the same training as the sons, ‘utilis
bello tulit . . . saeva paupertas‚’ &c., 1. 12. 42.

38—44. ‘To dig all day, and then, when even the bullocks were
tired out and loosed from the plough, to cut and carry fagots till
a stern mother called “ enough.'’ '

38. Sabellis ligonibus, see on 1. 31. 9 ‘ Calena falce! Sabellus

country-foll< of his own native district.

42. mutaret umbras, was making the shadows of the hills fall
another way from that in which they fell in the morning. The
whole stanza describes evening.

46-48. Horace seems to have had in view the lines of Aratus
(Phaen. 123) οἵην χρυσείην πατέρες· γενεὴν ἐλίποντο Ι χειροτέρην·
ὑμεῖς δέ κακώτερα τεξείεσθε.

47. daturos, ‘partu dabit Ilia prolem,' Virg. Aen. 1. 274.
