THE ODES OF HORACE

Phrygiae sorores. This climax points to the exhortation which
follows : If barbarian women dried their tears‚ perpetual lamenta-
tions may well be called ‘ molles ² in one who may sing of the arms
of Rome.

17. desine querelarum, after the model of the Greek genitive
with παύεσθαι, >linteam so Virg. Aen. 10. 441 ‘desistere pugnae.'
Horace similarly copies the genitive with ἀπέχεσθαι, Od. 3. 27. 69
‘ abstineto irarum,’ and with φθονεῖν, Sat. 2. 6. 84 ‘ Sepositi ciceris
nec longae invidit avenae.'

20. rigidum Niphaten, ‘ stiff frozen Niphates.’ , The later
Roman poets took it for a river: Lucan 3. 245 ‘volventem saxa
Niphaten’3 cp. Juv. 6. 409, Sil. 13. 765; and this is perhaps the
most natural interpretation of Virgil's metaphor, ‘ pulsum Niphaten ’
(cp. Aen. 11. 405 ‘ retro fugit Aufidus ’). The geographers‚ however,
recognize only a mountain of the name in Armenia. ‘N iphaten’
is, like ‘tropaea‚’ the direct object of ‘cantemus’ In the next
stanza Horace passes to another construction, viz. an object clause
in the accus. and infin.

21. Medum fiumen, the Euphrates. The expressions are very
parallel to Virg. Aen. 8. 726 ‘ Euphrates ibat iam mollior undis‚’
where also the Geloni and the Armenian Araxes appear.

23. intra praescriptum, ‘ within the bounds that we have set
them.'

Gelonos, see Introd. to Books i—iii‚ 1. ξ 7.

24. exiguis is predicative‚ ‘ and find them all too narrow.'

ODE X

‘THE wise sailor is neither tempted too far out tosea nor
frightened on to rocks and shallows. One who has learnt to love
the golden mean neither has a hovel with a roof falling in nor a
palace that would attract the evil eye. The higher the seat the
greater the fall. The wise man is prepared for fortune to change
like everything else. Be brave and hopeful if things are against
you, and so, too, do not spread all your sails because the wind
chances to be favourable.’

Horace recommends moderation of life and manners. Pro-
fessedly it is a mean that he praises; but it is clear throughout
that it is excess that he deprecates; the danger of defect is not
really before his mind. This is shown in the first part of the Ode

by omission—the hypothesis would require a stanza corresponding ν

to st. 3 to illustrate the danger of being too low, as that illustrates
the danger of being too high,—in the second part by the stress laid
on the alternative least contemplated, under cover of which the
poet at last ventures to put plainly the lesson on which his heart
is really set.
