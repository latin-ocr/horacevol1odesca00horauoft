application to the oppressor) between proud Tantalus and his
mythic raco who would escape death if they could, and the poor
man who looks to it as the end of his toils. The matter is clenched
by the suggestion of the last line that even for the poor man it is
no matter of choice.

35. Promethea, see on 2. 13. 37. We seem to have a fresh
point added to the legend here. The‘ satelles Orci' is Charon, as
app pears from the verb‘ revexit?

36. hio, Orcus. ‘Vocatus,’ &c.‚ would hardly suit Charon.

38. levare, after‘ vocatus!

ψεσθαι καὶ παρακαλούμενος καὶ ἄκλητος. Halm (in l{he third edition
of Orelli) suggests that Horace was thinking of Aesop's fable of
the old man and Death, though the point there is different.

. ODE XIX

THE poet imagines himself (vv. 1-4) to have come, while
wandering in the hius, on Bacchus amidst the Nymphs and Satyrs.
He describes dramatically (as though he felt them at the moment)
the effects of the sight: the fresh terror (χαλεποὶ δὲ θεοὶ φαίνεσθαι

ἐναργεῖς, Hom. Il. 20. 131), the rush of inspiration; delightful, yet

half painful, from its tumultuous excitement. Then he finds the
way of relies. He may sing the praises of Bacchusj of his power
to bless those whom he 'loved and destroy h1s enemles ; his power

. over inanimate nature, over noxious beastS, over the giant5‚ over

the monsters of Hades.

Compare Od. 3. 25. They both seem to be attempts to catch
something of the inspiration of a Greek dithyramb. That Ode
has a purpose; the present one is a mere study. There* is no
reason to believe that it is a reproduction of any single original.
The art of its composition, the climax through which the celebration
of Bacchus’ triumph rises, and the studiedly quiet conclusion after
the abrupt bursts of the beginning, as though the strained mind
had found relies and the ‘turbida laetitia’ run itself clear, are
Horatian rather than Greek.

Dillr. suggests that Horace had been lately reading Euripides’
Bacchae. T hat he had read it is pretty certain.

1. remotis, absolute‚‘ far away from the ways of men.'

rupibus: he is a mountain god, Soph. O. T. 1105.

2. credito posteri, cp. Epod. 9. 11 ‘posteri negabitis!

3. auris acutas. The epithet is for the eye3 ‘the sharp- pointed
ears? That the Satyrs were listening 15 implied in the selection of
their ears as the part which the poet saw. For the Nymphs and
{atyrs inhthis conjunction see 1 1. 31 ‘Nympharumque leves cum
