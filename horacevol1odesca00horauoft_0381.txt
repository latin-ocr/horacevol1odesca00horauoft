lines refer to the proportion of water with which the wine is to be
mixed in the mixing bowl, or to the number of ‘cyathi’ of wine ,
(mixed or unmixed as may be) to be served to the guests for each
toast. A majority of editors follow Acr. and Porph. in taking the
sbrmer view. The proportion of three parts water to one part
wine, which according to the common interpretation is the meaning
of the second clause, ‘ tres prohibet supra tangere,' though it seems
to us excessive, is yet one which is familiar in Greek literature.
It is the countryman's proportion in Hesiod, ''E. καὶ Ἡ. 596 τρὶς
ὕδατος προχέειν τὸ δὲ τέτρατον ἱέμεν οἴνου. In the discussion of the

’ , subject of the mixture of water and wine in Athenaeus (10. 27-29),

 

even a larger proportion of water is suggested, πολὺ βελτιον ἕνα καὶ
τέτταράς, though with the comment, ὑδαρῆ λέγεις. Horace would
be meaning to say, ‘ you may go to either extreme, have a mixture
strong enough for a toper or weak and safe enough for a water-
drinker.' It should be said that Acr. and Porph. avoid this
difficulty, though perhaps they introduce others, by taking the
second clause to give, not an alternative to the first, but a reason
for the limitation, ‘I say nine-twelsths, for the three parts further
(i. e. to make it ‘ merum ’ ; cp. ‘ nihil supra,’ ‘ nothing further,’ in
Ode 2. 18. 11) the Graces forbid? Bentley lends his authority to ·
the second view, which is that of the Comm. Cruq. In favour of it
is the strong argument that it harmonizes these expressions with
the other passage in which Horace speaks of such toasts 3. 8. 13
‘sume . . . cyathos amici sospitis centum,' where there is no
question of mixture. It suits also the natural interpretation of the
reference to this Ode which Bentley quotes from Ausonius, the
introduction to Idyll. 11, ‘Flacci ecloga in qua propter mediam
noctem et novam lunam et Murenae auguratum ternos ter cyathos
attonitus petit vates! The counting of the ‘cyathi ' with which
toasts were drunk is frequently referred to, as in Mart. 1. 72
‘ Naevia sex cyathis, septem Iustina bibatur,' &c. ‘ Miscentur' on
this view (and this is the chief argument used against it) has to be
taken, by a slight extension‚ in the simple sense of ἐγχεῖν, ἐπιχεῖν,
of pouring into the cup, without definite reference to mixture of
wine and water.

11. tribus aut: novem. Cp. Ausonius, Idyll. 11. 1 ‘Ter bibe
vel toties ternos: sic mystica lex est.’

12. miscentur. There is no need to alter with Rutgers and
Bentl. to “miscentorss The ‘arbiter bibendi' announces to the
guests as well as gives orders to the servants.

cyathis, As a measure of capacity the ‘ cyathus ' was the twelsth
of the ⁶ sextarius,’ that being nearly a pint.

commodis is taken by Bentley as = ‘ plenis,’ Orelli illustrates it
by Plautus’ ‘commodas minas,’ i. e. ‘of full weight ’; but perhaps
the Schol. are right who explain it by ‘aptis,’ i. e. suited to the
taste of the different drinkers. Cp. Sat. 2. 6. 67 foll. ‘ prout cuique
libido est Siccat inaequalis calices conviva,’ &Q
