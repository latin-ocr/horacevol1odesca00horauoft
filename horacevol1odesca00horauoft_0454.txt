ODE XV

‘ WARLIKE: victories‚ after all, are what Phoebus forbade me to

sing of. The glory of Caesar's reign is not war ; but peace, plenty, - ³

the standards recovered from Parthia, and the gate of Janus closed
—morality and the old character that gave Rome her empire

restored. While Caesar guards us, there is no fear that citizen -

 

will lift hand in civil war, or Dacian, Mede, or Scythian in foreign ..
war. For us, every day over the cheerful family board, when the ²⁵

due libations have been made to the gods, we will sing, as our

fathers sang before us, of the great captains of past time, and of .

the house of Anchises and Venus.’

We can hardly doubt that the Ode is intended as an epilogue to
the Book, the final answer to Augustus’ request. It has been sup—
posed by many editors to carry internal evidence of having been

composed as late as Β. c. 10. The sole argument is the mention in s

v. 9 of the closing of the temple of Janus, which was taken to refer
to the third closing in Augustus' reign, which has been placed in
that year. Franke shows that the evidence even of this date is

very doubtful, and in any case it is admitted that the gate was ⁷-

closed in the years 29 and 25, and there is no word in the Ode to
fix the reference to a third closing.

2. increpuit lyra, in the common sense of ‘increpare,' ‘to re-
prove,' but with reference to its original meaning, ‘ to make a noise
at,’ ‘ thundered at me on his 1yre.’ This mode of taking the words
is rendered certain by Ovid, A. A. 2. 493 ‘ Haec ego cum canerem,
subito manifestus Apollo Movit inauratae pollice fila lyrae,' διε.
All the Scholiasts took ⁴ lyra’ with ‘loqui‚' and Ritter, of modern
editors, follows thern. The general image is from Virg. E. 6. 3
‘Cum canerem reges et proelia, Cynthius aurem Vellit et admonuit.’

3. Tyrrhenum, apparently of a large and wide sea. Virgil had

before used the image of a poet's ventures, G. 2. 41 ‘pelagoque
volans da vela patenti,' and Ovid follows, Trist. 2. 328 ‘Non ideo
debet pelago se credere, si qua Audet in exiguo ludere cymba
lacu.'

5. The restoration of agriculture3 cp. 4. 5. 18.

6. nostro, opposed to the foreign gods, in whose temples they
have been hanging hitherto. The standards taken at Carrhae were
restored in B.c. 203 cp. Epp. 1. 18. 56.

9. Ianum Quirini. As Bentley shows, the usual name of this
gateway (translated on the Mon. Ancyr. by πύλην Ἐνυάλιον), which
