BOOK 11, ODE XIX, 6-—ODE XX

25. quamquam, qualifying what precedes, ‘and yet.’ ‘Sed’ is
again adversative to this concession.

28. mediusque. The‘ que' misplaced, as in v. 32· ‚ see on 1.
30. 6. It is a question whether‘ idem ’ or ‘medius' is the main
predicate. In the former case the verse will mean, ‘Thou wast the
same (i. e. equally vigorous and successful) in the midst of peace
and in the midst of war! In the latter we must interpret with
Orelli, ‘medius' τι ‘midway between peace and war‚’ meaning

‘equally adapted for peace and war.² No real parallel has been
quoted for the expression3 the sense is the same as Virgil’ s ‘pacis-
que bonas bellique ministras,’ Aen. 11. 658, quoted by Orelli.

29. insonS, without attempting to harm you.

aureo eornU, as Bacchus is represented on the stage, Eur.
Bacch. 920—922. Cp. ib. 100 ταυρόκερως,Αιἰϊ11. Ρ. 9. 524 χρυσόκερως.

30. atterens, wagging his tail, moving it from side to side on the
ground—‹rat'vmv——in pleased recognition at Bacchus’ approach; or
= ‘atterens tibi,' of a dog rubbing itself against a master or friend.
It is not the same action as Virgil’ s ‘caudamque remulcens subiecit
pavitantem utero' (Aen. 11. 812) of a wolf slinking away in terror.

31. trilingui ore, probably the tongue of each of his three
mouths, as Virgil’s ‘latratu trifauci,’ Aen. 6. 417. See on 2. 13. 33.
For the intentional dullness of this stanza see Introd. and cp. the
end of 3. 5 and 4. 2.

⁷ ODE XX

‘ HORACE will stay no longer on earth3 he will mount into the
clear air of heaven and laugh at his detractors. He whom the
envious world despises‚ but whom Maecenas loves, will not die
the common death of men. Already he feels himself changing to
a swan. All the world shall see him and hear his music: funeral
rites have no meaning for him?

I accept the suggestion of Pliiss (Horaz Studien, p. 179 f.) that
Horace speaks as from his funeral pyre, his friends standing round
and Maecenas as chief mourner. This gives a better sense than
any yet proposed to v. 6, it softens any grotesqueness in the sup-
posed metamorphosis, and it gives full force to the last stanza.

The point taken is then exactly the same as in Ennius' epitaph
on himself which is clearly in Horace’s mind :

‘Nemo me lacrimis decoret, neque funera fletu
faxit. Cur? volito vivus per ora virum?

Compare Virgil’s imitation of the same (G. 3. 8) ε

‘Temptanda via est, qua me quoque possim
tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora’

The Ode doubtless owes its place at the end of a Book to its
general reference to Horace and his poetic fame3 but it hardly
