Bosphorum, 2. 13. 4, 2. 20. 14.

32. litoris Assyrii, probably of the Syrian desert, Assyrius

and cp. Virg. G. 2. 465.

viator, opposed to ‘navita,’ as ‘ viae’ to ‘ mare‚' 2. 6. 7.

33. Britannos, Catull. 1 1. 11 ‘horribilem insulam ultimosque Bri-
tannos.’ Tac. Ann. 14. 30 accuses the Druids of human sacrifices.

34. Concanum, a tribe of the Cantabri. Virgil attributes the
mixing of milk with horse’s blood to the Geloni (G. 3. 463), Statius
to the Massagetae (Ach. 1. 307). Silius (3. 360) joins the Massa-
getae and the Concani.

35. pharetratos, Virg. Aen. 8. 725 ‘sagittiferosque Gelonos.’
All the localities have epithets to express the savagery of the
inhabitants except ‘ Scythicum amnem‚' where ‘inviolatus ' has the
samacel effssct by implying that others could not visit the Tanais with

q37. vos {upplies the connexion with the preceding stanzas, as if
it were ‘vos eaedem.' The same Muses who protect the poet are
the solace of Caesar, glad to have done with war and to listen
to their gentle counsels.

Acron interpreting it by ‘interius recondidit.’ Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 5 of
the retired gladiator, ‘latet abditus agro.’ Orelli, following B, gave
‘addidit,’ which is used in the same connexion, as if it were the
technical word, in Tac. Ann. 13. 31 ‘ Coloniae Capua atque Nuceria
additis veteranis firmatae sunt.’ Bentley supports ‘reddidit'
(which also has some MS. authority) by Tac. Ann. 1. 17 ‘ praetorias
cohortes quae post sedecim annos penatibus suis reddidit) In
point of sense, ‘ abdidit’ or ‘ reddidit ’ are preferable to ‘ addidit: as
helping the general idea that the war is over. It is the soldiers,
not the towns, that Horace is thinking of. ‘Addidit’ would view
the action from the side of the towns. The two occasions in the
life of Augustus, before B.c. 23, on which we have record of his
settling veterans on purchased land or in colonies, are after the
bellum Actiacum in 13.c. 30 (Dion, 51. 4), and in 13.c. 25 or 24
(Dion, 53. 25) at the close of his Spanish campaign. · See Mommsen,
R. G. Div. Aug. 3. 22-28.
