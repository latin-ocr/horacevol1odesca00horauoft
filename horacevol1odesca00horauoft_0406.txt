THE ODES OF HORACE

15. aulaeis. These are explained to be an awning between the Ι

roos and the table. At N aS1d1enus supper they fall and bring down
the accumulated dust with them on the table3 Sat. 2. 8. 54. Cp.
Virg. Aen. 1. 697 with Conington’ 5 110ῐο.

ostr03 ib. 700‘ stratoque super discumbitur ostro,’ of the purple
coverings of the couches.

16. explicuere3 Sat. 2.2. 125 ‘Explicuit vino contractae seria
frontis? The tense is regular, ‘ have often ere now, '&c. As Madvig
points out (Opusc. Acad. 2, p. 114), the so· -called‘ aoristic' use

of the perfect 15 its use without‘ plerumque’ (which 15 present here) ¹

or some word of similar generalizing force, as though such a word

had been present, 500 Ο(1. 1. 34. 16.

b 57. clarus 15 predicative,‘ shows brightly the fire he had 111(1(1011
0 ore?

Andromedae pater, Cepheus. According to Columella, this
. constellation rose in the evening on July 9.

18. Procyon, in Latin ‘ Antecanem' or ‘Antecanis’ (Cic. N. D.
2. 44), and sometimes ‘Canicula,’ the Little Dog, which, on the
same authority, rose in the morning on July 15.

19. stella Leonis. The Lion, the sign of the Zodiac, into which
the sun passed on Aug. 1, Columel. 11. 2, § 51. The loose use
¹of ‘ stella' for a constellation is found 111 Virgil also, as G. 1. 222. ,

22. 1;101·1·1(1.ί---·ζ hirsuti.’ The epithet serves to recall 1115 image,
and perhaps also to suggest the depth of the forest where the
‘ uncouth ’ inhuman wood-god lives.

25. etatus; cp. Cicero’s division, Mur. 11. 24 ‘ omnia quae sunt in
imperio et in statu civitatis‚' almost = ‘ foreign and home politics.'

27. Sere33 see on 1. 12. 56.

regnata Cyro Baetra, for construction cp. 2. 6. 11 ⁶ regnata . . .
Laconi Rura Phalantho! ‘ Bactra ' is used for the Parthian empire,
as are ‘Persia' and ‘Media’; ‘Cyro’ as 2. 2. 17 ‘Cyri solio.'
Probably (as Kiessling) the suggested or expressed epithets in each
case are intended to imply the needlessness of anxiety—the Seres

[distant in place], the Scythians, occupied with quarrels of their ,

own; and so this description of the Parthian is meant to suggest
a distance of time, they belong to the old world.

28. 'I'anais discors. The Tanais (now the Don) stands for the Α

Scythians (cp. 3. 10. 1, 4. 15. 24). For the embassy of the Scythians,
which, according to Orosius (6.21. 19), came to August us while he
was at TarraCO, see on Od. 2. 9. With the argument contained m
the epithet ‘discors,' cp. 3. 8. 19 ‘Medus infestus sibi luctuosis
Dissidet armis.’

29. prudens3 1. 3. 22.

32. trepidat3 2.11 4.

33. componere aequus=‘ aequo animo ordinare? The editors
quote from Suidas the words of Cratinus: ἄνδρας σοφοὺς ἐχρῆν τὸ
παρὸν πρᾶγμα εἷς δύναμιν θέσθαι καλῶς. ‘Componerej however, has
more distinctly the idea of‘ reducing to order' (as in ‘componere
litis,’ ancl 111 1055 matters‘ componere togam ’); it has reference to
