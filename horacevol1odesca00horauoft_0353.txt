fidis’ explains and Justifies‘ credidit' ; although without such an
opposition, ‘ dedidit ’ or ‘ tradidit' would be, as Bentley shows, the
more usual verb. The ‘ perfidy' of the foes to whom he surrenders
is in point, both as showing by a side touch the folly ofhis cowardice,
and also, like the ‘closeness’ of the toils‚ as contributing to unman
the soldier who has once been in their power. “

timuitque mortem. Bentley connects these words with the
following stanza, and reads‘ timuitque mortem Hinc unde vitam
sumeret aptius, Pacem et duello miscuit,’ 1. e. has shrunk from the
swerd, which to a brave man is the security of life, as though it
were only an implement of death. ‘Aptius’ is found in several
MSS„ and some of value, but there is no trace of the other altera-
tions, ‘hinc,’‘ et‚' which it seems to necessitate. ‘Inscius’ is found
in the great majority of MSS, and was read by all the Scholiasts,
one of whom interprets‘ qui nesciret vitam viro forti potius de
armis sperandam) Bentley objects to the vulg. ., that the last charge
‘ timuitque mortem’ involves‘ minorem culpam quam ea quae
praecesserant? But it is quite in the old Roman spirit to sum up
the baseness of the captives in the charge that they ‘ feared death!

sumeret. The subjunctive has to do double duty ; for that mood
would be required if it were merely the indirect question, ‘ ignorant
whence he drew '; but it has a further force, as representing the
deliberative ‘unde sumam?’ Cp. Epod. 5. 85 ‘ dubius unde
rum eret.

peace and war’; in the latter safety is to be won only by the sword.

41. fertur. Cp. 3. 20. 12: it is the common formula when the
narrator would throw the responsibility of his narrative on hearsay
or tradition. Here it is intended to call a momentary attention to
the contrast between the spirit of Regulus and the spirit of modern
Rome. ‘Strange as it sounds, they tell us.’
