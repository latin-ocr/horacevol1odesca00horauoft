THE EPODES OF HORACE

17. caprificos, a common growth of cemeteries ς Juv. 10. 145.

19, 20. The construction is ‘uncta ranae sanguine ova strigis .
plumamque.’ Compare a charm for a similar purpose in Prop. 3. 6. 27

‘ Illum turgentis ranae portenta rubetae Et lecta exsectis anguibus ³³
ossa trahunt, Et strigis inventae per busta iacentia plumae.’ ‘ Strix ’ <
is the screech-ow1,· the ‘rana turpis ' is the ‘rubeta,' a toad, so .

called because found in bramble- thickets; it was believed to be ζ,

poisonous. Plin. N. H. 32. 5, Juv. 1. 69.
21. 101505, in Thessaly, cp. v. 45, and Od. 1. 27. 21 ‘Thessalis
Magus ν51151115.’

Hiberia, strictly the country lying between the Caucasus on the ¹

north, Armenia on the south, Colchis, which separated it from the

Euxine, on the west, and Albania, which separated it from „
the Caspian, on the east. Its inhabitants professed (Tac. Ann. 6. 34) ,

to be 'descendants of the Thessalians who sailed with Jason3
Virg. E. 8. 95 ‘ Has herbas atque haec Ponto mihi lecta venena.’
23. ossa, perhaps human bones, the dogs being those that

 

prowled about a graveyard. Orelli quotes Apul. Met. 1, who ,

mentions among the ingredients of a philtre‚ ‘a skull torn from
between the teeth of a wild beast.' In any case they are appro-
priate to this ‘desideri poculum? as typical of the rage of dis· .
appointed animal passion. Compare in this respect the more · ‘
potent spell of vv. 37—40. -

24. Colchicis=‘ magicis, ’such as Medea might have kindled.

25. expedita=‘ succincta} Sat. 1. 8. 23.

26. Avernalis, as the witch in Virg. Aen. 4. 512 ‘Sparserat et
latices simulatos fontis Avemi.'

28. currens. The epithet seemed out of place to Bentley, as

the boar’s bristles do not rise more when he is running, and he »

advocates Heinsius’ conjecture ‘Laurens’ But‘ currens’ is in
point as completing the whole resemblance of the boar to Sagana
bustling about. It has the more place, as we have had no definite
verb to express her movements.

29. abacta nulla conscientia, ‘not one whit deterred by her
consciousness of what she was doing,’ i.e. of its cruelty and wicked-
ness. For the use of ‘ nulla ’ 555 011 Od. 3. 20. 7.

30. duris, not quite an inert epithet, if we compare Od.3. 11. 31,
4. 4. 57. The ‘hardness' of the iron is in a way identified with the
persistence of her purpose—she would dig till the iron was tired.

humum, the soil 111 the ‘impluviumg of the house (v. 25) in
which the scene is laid.

33. bie terque. So all the good MSS. and the editors since
Bentley, against the v. l. ‘bis terve.’ He points out that the two
readings differ materially in sense. ‘Bis terque’ == ‘sssaepe cp.
A. P. 439 ‘melius te posse negares, Bis terque expertum frustra’· ,

‘bis terve’ = ‘,’raro cp. A. P. 358.

34. inemori spectaculo, ἐναποθνήσκειν τῇ θέᾳ. ‘ Inemori’ is an
ἄπα λε .

gg. siispensa mento explains ‘ quantum exstant aqua,’ ‘as much
