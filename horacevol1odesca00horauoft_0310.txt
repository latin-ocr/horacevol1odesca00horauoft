THE onEs OF HORACE

. l
as Cic. Verr. 2. 3. 11 ‘damnare octupli.’ It follows perhaps the a
analogy of the genitive with verbs of estimating, and signifies'the i
equivalent at which the crime is assessed. ⁴

20. Sisyphus, Hom. Od. 11. 593.

21. Compare Lucret. 3. 907 foll. ‘ Nam iam non domus accipiet
te laeta, neque uxor Optima,' &a

23. cupressos, ‘funebris.’ Epod. 5. 18; ‘feraleS,’ Virg. Aen.
6. 216. They are used in the latter passage to ornament in some
way the funeral pile. Orelli quotes Ovid, Met. 10. 141, where
Apollo says to Cyparissus just changed into the tree that was to Ἰ
bear his name, ‘ Lugebere nobis, Lugebisque alios aderisque dolen-
tibus.’

24. brevem, as ‘brevis flores rosae,’ 2. 3. 13, ‘ master on a short ⁷
tenure,' cp. Epp. 2. 2. 172.

25. Caecuba, 1. 20. 9. The plural is of quantity, cp. 2. 1. 5.

dignior, ‘ worthier,’ apparently, because he makes a wiser use of
it; but there is a certain bitterness in the epithet. Cp. Sat. 2. 3.
122 ‘ Filius aut etiam libertus ut ebibat heres . . . custodis!

27. tinget pavimentum, Cic. Phil. 2. 41. 105, of the spilt wine
of a profuse and drunken banquet, ‘N atabant pavimenta vino,
madebant parietes!

superbo, ‘lordly.’ ‘Pro “ipse superbus ”3 Hypallage figura‚’
Acr. Horace makes it the epithet of ‘mer0,’ as though the wine
itself showed lordliness-‘ generosity ’-—at once in its quality and in
allowing itself to be so squandered. The asyndeton, ‘superbo . . .
piptigress indicates, as Orelli says, that the second epithet justifies
t e rst.

28. Od. 1. 37. 2 ‘Saliaribus dapibus'3 Mart. 12. 48. 2 ‘Non
&lbana mihi sit comissatio tanti, Non Capitolinae Pontificumque

apes.

ODE XV

‘ OUR palaces 'and fish-ponds and ornamental gardens are sup-
planting the cultivation of corn and vines and olives. This is >not
the spirit of our sires. Their rule was private thrift, public magni-
ficence3 houses of turf, public buildings and temples of hewn stone.’

Compare the introduction to Ode 18. Both Odes (and to some
extent 16 al'so) deal with evils which in iii. 1-6 and 24 the social
and religious legislation of Augustus is set forth as about to remedy. ·
Some similarities of expression show that Horace was conscious of
this relation between the Odes. See notes on 3. 1. 36, 38, 45,
3· 24· 4· .

With the special subject of this Ode compare the letter of Tiberius
to the Senate in Tac. Ann. 3. 53 foll„ esp. such sentences as ‘Quod
primum prohibere et priscum ad morem recidere aggrediar? villa· Α
rumne infinita spatia? familiarum numerum et nationes? argenti et
auri pondus? . . . At Hercule nemo refert quod Italia externae opis Δ
