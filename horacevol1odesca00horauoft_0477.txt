EPODE V, 57-88

have made him despair of life, but he will curse her before he dies.
The editors compare the behaviour of Drusus towards Tiberius, in
Tac. Ann. 6. 24 ‘ubi exspes vitae fuit meditatas compositasque
diras imprecabatur.'

85. ,dubius unde, &c. His doubt was Dido’s, Virg. Aen. 4. 371
‘ Quae quibus anteferam ? ’

86. Thyesteas, such as Thyestes might have uttered against
Atreus, the murderer of his children.

87, 88. No interpretation more satisfactory on the whole has been
offered of these hard lines, than that suggested by Lambinus, and
adopted among recent editors by Dillr„ and in its main points by
Munro. This makes ‘venena,’ in the sense of φαρμακεῖαι, ‘vene-
ficia,’ the subject of the sentence, and understands an affirmative
‘valent’ with the first clause. ‘ Sorceries may overset the mighty
laws of right and wrong, they cannot overset the law of natural
retribution,' i.e. you may disregard divine laws and kill me, but
Ι shall have my turn yet, ‘Diris agam vos) The merits of this
interpretation are that the particular expressions ‘convertere fas
nefasque' and ‘humanam vicem’ will harmonize naturally, the
first with Virgil's ‘fas versum atque nefas‚' G. 1. 505, the second
with Horace’s own ‘vices superbae,’ Od. 1. 28. 32. We may notice
the additional parallel of ib. v. 34 ‘ Teque piacula nulla resolvent’
to ‘dira detestatio Nulla expiatur victima.’ Bentley quotes also
Ov. Trist. 3. 1. 167 ‘ Humanaeque mem'or sortis quae tollit eosdem
Et premit, incertas ipse verere' vices.’ That the construction of
the sentence, although it is perhaps harsh for Horace, is yet Latin,
Lambinus shows from Cic. ad Att. 10. 1 ‘istum qui filium Brun-
disium de pace misit, me legatum iri non arbitror’=‘ that he, &c.‚
will be sent as envoy, not I.’ Munro would amend this version of
the lines by separating ‘ magnum ’ from ‘ fas nefasque,' and making
it=‘id quod magnum est,’ ‘sorceries, such is their power, can
overset,' διε. Of other interpretations, the best seem to be those
which explain ‘humanam vicem’ by Sallust’s ‘pecorum vicem
obtruncabantur,’ Cicero’s ‘ Sardanapali vicem mori‚' ad Att. 10. 8,
‘after the fashion of men,’ ἀνθρώπων δίκην. It would still be
a question whether ‘ venena' was the object of ‘ convertere ’ or the
subject of ‘ valent.’ In the first case it=‘ veneficae,’ as ‘ scelus ' is
used for a wicked person3 there is an obvious point in refusing
them a more personal appellation, when the statement is that they
have no human hearts to be moved. The line of thought then is,
‘ Conscience cannot move you, my curses may at least punish you!
If we take it in the second way it will mean, ‘ The mighty laws of
right and wrong are not like human things, that sorceries should
have power to overset them. You may kill me, but I shall be
revenged on you yet.’

N either MSS. nor Scholia give any variations of the text, and
none of the conjectures are attractive. Bentley (who offers it very
hesitatingly) proposes ‘magica,’ ‘non vertere,’ Haupt ‘maga non’
which Kiessling adopts, Keller ‘ humana invicem.'
