'THE ODES OF HORACE

general thirst for wealth, which belies sumptuary laws, but two
explanations of the merchant’s boldness: if the sea is rough the
seaman is cunning (for the relation of the two adjectives see on
1. 3. 10) to overcome its difficulties, and in any case there is the
prevailing motive behind, the dread of the one great shame,
over .

p 42. tymag-num opprobrium3 Sat. 2. 3. 92 ‘ Credidit ingens
Pauperiem vitium.’

44. arduae, predicative. That the hill is steep is the reason why
men turn out of the path.

tion is shared between vel and ηοω ‘vel’ ‘vel ’ emphasizing the
indifference of the smaller consideration, ‘ anywhere that you please
-give it to the gods or throw it into the sea’3 and so the
importance of the greater one, ‘only get quit of it once for all’:
‘nos‚’ ‘nos’ singling out the poet and the audience whom he
addresses from the rest of the world ; ‘let us at least,' the ‘ melior
pars ’ of Epod. 16.

45. in Capitolium. Horace already imagines the triumphal
processio-n in which, amid the popular joy, the mischievous gold
will be conducted to the capitol. Its destination was probably
suggested by the gifts which Augustus had made, or was about to
make, to that temple. Suet. Oct. 30 ‘in cellam Capitolini Iovis
sedecim milia pondo auri gemmasque ac margaritas quingenties
H. S. una donatione contulit.’ Cp. generally Od. 3. 3. 49-52.

48. gemmas et lapides. For the same distinction the editors
quote Ov. de Med. Fac. 20, 21 ‘Conspicuam gemmis vultis habere
manum: Induitis collo lapides oriente petitos’3 Mart. 11. 49. 4
‘Gemma vel a digito vel cadit aure lapis! One might fancy from
these lines that ‘ gemma ' meant specially a stone set and graven;
and passages are quoted in which ‘lapis’ is used specially of a

pearl. In any case the double substantive will mean ‘ jewels of

every kind ’; see above, v. 12.
49. summi mali, ‘ dictum ut summa res publica, summa salus,’
Orelli, ‘ the occasion of the chief offending.’

50. bene = ‘ vere‚’ ‘to any good purpose.’ Cp. the uses of

‘male,’ ‘male sanus‚’ &c.

51. eradenda . . . elementa. 1f any full metaphor is felt, it
would seem to be of rubbing out the characters on a waxed tablet.
The στοιχεῖα, rudiments, alphabet, of avarice must be effaced‚ the
mind must become once more καθαρὸς πίναξ.

cupidinis, masc„ see on 2. 16. 153 here, as there, it is the
desire of money.

54. rudis, with ‘ nescit’ ; it is antithetical to ‘ doctior ’ ; ‘ knows
not, for he has never been taught this lesson.’

57. Graeco. For the comparison of true Roman sports to the
more fashionable Greek ones cp. Sat. 2. 2. 9 foll. ‘ leporem sectatus
equove Lassus ab indomito—vel si Romana fatigat Militia adsuetum
