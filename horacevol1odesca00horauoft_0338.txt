THE ODES OF HORACE

41. insultet, ἐπισκιρτᾷ, ἐπιθρώσκει. Although the word is used in
its proper sense, there is still a feeling of its tropical sense; to
‘leap upon' a grave being a mode of ‘insulting’ the memory of
its tenant, Hom. Il. 4. 177 τύμβῳ ἐπιθρώσκων Μενελάου κυδαλίμοιο.
Compare with Juno’s words the actual description of the Troad in

Lucan 9. 966 foll.

grass-grown ruins of Troy. Cp. Virg. 8. 348 ‘Capitolia . . . Aurea

possit, ‘ be mighty to.’ Orelli quotes Tibull. 1. 7. 3 ‘Aquitanas
qui posset fundere gentis.’ It exalts the greatness of the seat.

44. ferox, as it were, ‘at the sword's point ’; but the two
epithets ‘triumphatis,’ ‘ ferox,’ are antithetical, contrasting the
attitude of the two peoples. Cp. ‘ Latium ferox,' 1. 35. 10.

hand that snatches for mortal uses all that is sacred.’

50. fortior = ‘dum fortior sit.’ It is a question whether this
condition grammatically qualifies the ‘ extendat ' of the preceding
stanza, or the ‘ tanget ’ of the following one. It is better, perhaps,
to take it with the former, as the latter matches more closely with
the condition laid down in v. 57 foll. ‘ Let her name be known in

all shores from East to West, only as the despiser of gold, not as

the greedy searcher for it. She shall go to the world’s end, to the
tropics and the pole, only not to Troy.' This stanza seems to con-
firm the view that Horace, under the talk of Troy, is thinking ot
real moral dangers of his country.

51. humanos in usus must be taken with ‘rapiente,’ as it
is antithetical to ‘ sacrum,’ ‘cogere' to ‘spernere.’

53—56. ‘ Whatever bounds have been set to the world she shall ᾖ

reach them with her arms, and rejoice to see with her own eyes in
what quarter fiery heat revels unchecked‚ in what quarter the mists
and dews of rain.’ The great majority of MSS. read ‘tanget ’ as

against ‘ tangat’3 and there is some force in Juno’s grudging assent 2⁷-

passing into a distinct prophecy (cp. ‘fata dico‚’ v. 57) of Rome’s
greatness, provided only as before that her condition is observed.
54. visere, of seeing as a sight. Cp. Od. 2. 15. 3.
55. debacchentur, see on ‘decertantem,’ 1. 3. 13. For the
description of the torrid and frigid zones cp. 1. 22. 17 foll„ and
