THE ODES OF *HORACE ἲ

3. prope vietor, ‘before he could complete the victory which,
by slaying Hector, he had all but won.’ The death of Achilles is ι
treated by Homer (in Hector’s prophecy, Il. 22. 358) as the joint ‘3
work of Paris and Apollo ; Virgil follows him, Aen. 6. 56 ‘Phoebe, 3
gravis Troiae semper miserate labores, Dardana qui Paridis derexti ·
tela manusque Corpus in Aeacidae’ ; Sophocles attributes it directly
to Apollo, Phil. 334 NE. τέθνηκεν, ἀνδρὸς οὐδενός, θεοῦ δ’ ὕπο Ι τοξευτός, “
ὡς λέγουσιν, ἐκ Φοίβου δαμείς.

4. Phthius. Phthia is Achilles' country in Homer, 11. 1. 155, &a

7. Dardanae. For the form see on 1. 15. 10. ⁴

8. cuspide, his famous spear; Hom. 11. 19. 387 Ἐκ δ’ ἄρα σύριγ· l

pendent Xeither of ‘qua'teret’ or of ‘ pugnax‚’ ‘made the towers of ἒ
Troy quake before the repeated onset of his terrible spear.' ξ

9-13. ille . . . ille supply the want of any more definite contrast, Ξ
by logical conjunctions, of the two pictures, of what was and what ξ
φητζξῐιί have been if Apollo had not interfered.

9, 10. ‘ As a pine cleft by the axe, or a cypress blown down by
the east wind.’ Perhaps the double simile is meant to touch two ’.“
stages in the same action : ‘ so Achilles was stricken down, and so 32
he fell? Cp. the double simile at the beginning of 4. 4. '

9. mordaci, eating into the wood at every stroke. ,.

11. procidit 1ate3 Agamemnon, of Achilles' death, in Hom. Od. ζ
24. 39 σὺ δ’ ἐν στροφάλιγγι κονίης Ι κεῖσο μέγας μεγαλωστί. ᾎῘ

13. Minervae saera mentito, ‘that seigned Minerva’s worship’; j
Virg. Aen. 2. 17 and 183. ξ

14. male feriatos, ‘keeping ill-timed holiday ’; Virg. Aen. 2. “
248, 9, Eur. Troad. 515 foll. .

16. falleret, for ‘fefellisset,’ Sat. 1. 6. 80. Madv. ξ 347, obs. 2,
gives instances of the substitution even in rhetorical prose: cp. ’
Virg. Aen. 5. 325, 6. 293 : ‘ he was not one to surprise,' ὅτε.

17. palam eaptis gravis. His foemen would have been taken

answers to the key-note of the last stanza‚ ‘ mentito . . . falleret,’ is
meant to enable it in thought to qualify both ‘ captis ’ and ‘ gravis.'
‘He was open throughout; he resorted to no stratagem, and he
affected no clemency.’ The fact that some of the other MSS. leave
a gap in the place of ‘ captis‚’ while in the later MSS. other words
are found, ‘victor‚’ ‘raptor,’ ‘capt0s,’ seems to Bentley to show that .
all are alike conjectural restorations of a word lost in early copies. =.
Compare a similar case in Epp. 2. 2. 199. ,

heu nefas! heu! Compare the sigh in ‘Heu pervicacis ad pedes
Achillei: Epod. 17. 14.

19. latentem. The singular, which Lambinus and Cruquius had
altered, is very likely due, as Bentley pointed out, to Hom. Il. 6. 58, ἴ·
Horace having accommodated to Achilles the words of AgamQs
