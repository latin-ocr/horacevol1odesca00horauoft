ODE VI

‘WE are suffering for our fathers’ sins. They let the temples go
to ruin. They let the sacredness of marriage laws be tampered
with. Our blood is poisoned, and we go from bad to worse. They
sprang from different parents, and had healthier homes, who
conquered Pyrrhus and Antiochus and Hannibal. Our sons will
be worse than we are. Where is the remedy? '

This Ode, though probably written before it, is in subject the
complement of the last. It traces to its source the decline of the
military spirit of which that complains, and includes in the arraign—
ment Roman daughters and mothers. As that points to Augustus’
plans of foreign conquest, so this points to his restoration of
temples and religious ceremonial (cp.2. 15) and his legislation on

social quest1ons (cp. 3. 24, 4. 5. 21 foll.; Carni. Saec. 17, 20) Cp.
Suet. Oct. 30, and Medvale, ch. 33.

1. immeritus, not that Horace would say generally that the
existing generation was innocent, but their punishment was not all?
for their own sins. In part they were ‘ paying for the sins of their
sires in which they had had no share, ' and would continue to pay
for them till they undid them.

2. Romane, a general address to the people, Sat. 1. 4. 85, cp.
A. P. 54, Virg. Aen. 6. 852.

templa. waedesque synonyms, the second substantive being
only a vehicle for the epithet, like Virgil’s ‘ Limen erat caecaeque
fores . . . postesque relicti.’

refeceris, the task that Augustus was engaged in, Suet. Oet. 30
‘Aedes sacras vetustate collapsas aut incendio absumptas refecit!

4. fumo, perhaps from the ‘incendia' of which Suet. l. c.
s eaks.

p5. te minorem geris, cp. 1. 1'2. 57 ‘Te minor latum reget aequus
orbern)

6. hine, sc. ‘est.’ Liv. 45. 39 ‘maiores vestri omnia magnarum
rerum et principia exorsi ab Dis sunt et finem statuerunt! It is
the sorgetfulness of this which has constituted the ‘neglect ' of the
next verse.

For the scansion of principium see on 3. 4. 41.

7. neglecti, ‘because they were forgotten,’ 3. 2. 30 ‘Diespiter
neglectus.’

9. bis Monaeses et Pacori manus. Three defeats of Roman
armies by the Parthians are recorded— that of Crassus at Carrhae
by Surenas, Β. C. 533 that of Decidius Saxa, legatus of M. Antony,
in Syria by l’acorus, the son of Orodes, and Labienus the republican
renegade, in Β. C. 403 and that of M. Antony in Media in Β. C. 36.
Pacorus himself had been killed in battle in Β. C. 38. The only
Monaeses known to history was the Parthian noble who, having
ssed, like many othere, from the tyranny of Phraates IV (the son to
