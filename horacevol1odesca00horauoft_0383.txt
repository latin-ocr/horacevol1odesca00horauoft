metaphorical, ‘whether you or she gain the greater booty' (‘ praeda
maior’ = p‘lus praedae' ) the fact being out of view that in the
interpretation the‘ booty' ἰ5 a single person and therefore there is

γ’ no ‘more' or less. But in any case the substitution of‘ maior' for

‘magisss adj. for adv„ is a common confusion in language; see

Madv. §300, and cp. :Epod. 5. 29 ‘nulla conscientiass Sat. 1. 7. 28

si quem. .videat’ ‘if he could see anything of Antheus.'

11. posuisse, with a present force, ‘to have placed,' and so

kto be keeping’ there. See Conington’s notes on Virg. G. 1. 25,
en. 2. 2 7.

12. paimanm the palm of victor-y sor which they are contending.
The attitude at once displays his foot and expresses his lordly
indifference to the issue of the quarrel. ‘’Palmam has also been
taken (see Orelli) of the palm of the hand3 of one leg thrown over
the other and held m the hand‚—a mere picture.

13. fertur, perhaps=‘ they tell me,’ a common way of indicating
the strangeness of what we report, as though we did not venture to
vouch for it. See on 3. 5. 41.

Ρξεεὶἱέγ, as Orelli thinks, only by letting the wind play on his
s oul ers.

15. Nireus; see Epod. 15. 22, ‘Formaque vincas Nirea.' In
both cases the MSS. read almost unanimously ‘ N ereus,' ‘Nerea.'
Here R is the only one which has‘ Nireus. ’ The Scholiasts had
the true reading, for they quote or refer to Homer's description,
Il. 2. 673 Νιρεύς, ὃς κάλλιστος’ ανὴρ ὑπὸ Ἴλιον ἦλθε Ι τῶν ἄλλων Δαναῶν
μετ’ ἀμύμονα Πηλεΐωνα.

16. raptus, sc. Ganymede. the participle used substantivally=

ODE XXI

WRITTEN in anticipation of entertaining M. Valerius Messalla
Corvinus. Dillr. bids us compare with this Ode Epp. 1. 5.

‘Jar of Massic, as old as myself, your potent contents were kept
for some happy occasion, and they shall be broached to-day for
Corvinus. He, philosopher as he is, will not despise you. Old
Cato, they tell us, did not object to a cup of wine. You make

Corvinus (the ‘ Messalla' of Sat. 1. 6. 42, 1. 10. 85, Α. Ρ. 371
