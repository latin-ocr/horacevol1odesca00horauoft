THE EPODES OF HORACE

her rivals as he comes through the Subura ? The first view would .
be illustrated by the sign of Daphnis' approach in answer to the .

spells in Virgil's Pharmaceutria‚ E. 8. 107 ‘ Hylax in limine latrat!

The second, however, gives a better explanation of ‘quod omnes >
rideant,’ and of the care with which she has herself prepared the ,

persumed unguent, which he uses in his vanity without guessing its
purpose. She is meant to make him (and herself thereby) ridi-
culous to the reader; but she would not wish him to be laughed at,
except as a means of keeping him to herself.

58. Suburanae. ‘ Subura ⁹ was the broad hollow formed by the
junction of the valleys between the Quirinal, Viminal‚ and Esquiline
hius, and opening on the Fora. It was a busy part of Rome, but
1135 3 bad name in the poets ; Prop. 4. 7. 15, Mart. 6. 66, Juv. 3. 3. 5.

59. ‘ Of such sort as my hands could never bring to greater
perfection ' ; cp. Sat. 1. 5. 41 ‘ animae qualis neque candidiores
Terra tulit neque quis me sit devinctior alter,' ‘ souls of such sort
as never walked the earth more purely white‚’ &c.

61. quid. accidit ἱ) She perceives that her spells have failed.

62. venena Medeae, philtres such as Medea's, as ‘ flammis
Colchicis,’ v. 24. ·

63. Cp. Epod. 3. 13.

superbam is the reading of V, and sound and sense support it.
But ‘superba,’ the reading of B, has almost better authority, as it
was found by Acr.‚ who interprets ‘ potens.'

 

67. latens asperis; ‘ I have not omitted any herb of powers ἶ

because it was hard to find or grew in a difficult place.'

69, 70. The best interpretation seems to be, ‘ the bed he sleeps
on has been smeared with a drug to make him forget all other
mistresses.’ It is a continuation of her assurances to herself, that
no precaution has been omitted.

71. a! a! The truth suddenly occurs to her.

solutum Od. 1. 27. 21.

ambulat, ‘walks where he will'3 i.e. is not bound by the spell
to come to me.

75. neo vocata . . . vocibus, ‘ nor shall it be at the summons of
Marsian spells that thy heart shall come back to me,’ ‘ Marsis
vocibus' corresponding to ‘usitatis potionibus ’ in the last clause,
both being answered by ‘Maius parabo, maius infundam,' διε.
This interpretation gives a more continuous sense than the older
one, ‘nor shall thy heart go back again (i. e. from me), though
summoned by Marsian spells.' The Marsi were famous in sorcery;
Epod. 17. 29, Virg. Aen. 7. 750 foll.

77. maius parabo, sc. ‘quiddam' Only the second ‘maius'
goes with ‘poculum’

infundam, ‘ Ι will mix.’

79. inferius, the last two syllables coalesce ; see on Epod. 2. 3 5.

82. atria, of the smoky flame of the burning bitumen. With
these two lines cp. Virg. E. 8. 80·8 3.

83. sub haee, ‘on hearing this ’ς Sat. 2. 8. 43. Canidia's words
