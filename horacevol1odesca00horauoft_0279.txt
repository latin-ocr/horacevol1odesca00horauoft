BOOK II, ODE I, 1-29

16. Delmatico, Virg. E. 8. 6 soll. Pollio was sent by Antony
against the Parthini, an Illyrian tribe who had espoused the cause
of Brutus and Cassius. He defeated them, and took their chief
town, Salonae. For the ablative see above on v. 12.

19. fugaces, pred. ‘ scares them till they would fain fly.²

20. equitum vultus, compare Plutarch Caes. 45 (in the account
Of the battle of Pharsalia) οὗ γὰρ ἠνείχοντο τῶν ὑσσῶν ἀναφερομένων
οὐδ’ ἐτόλμων ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς τὸν σίδηρον ὁρῶντες, ἀλλ’ ἀπεστρέφοντο
καὶ συνεκαλύπτοντο φειδόμενοι τῶν προσώπων.

21. audire . . . duces, ‘to hear you reading of chiefs,’ &c- Others
take it of hearing the voices of the chiefs haranguing or giving
command in the battle. Both interpretations are as old as Acron.
The latter would suit better with the preceding stanza3 but there
would be a harsh zeugma in the use of ‘ audire,’ which, with ‘ cuncta
terrarum subacta,' must mean ‘to hear of'; and although ‘non
indecoro pulvere sordidos’ may refer only to the dust and heat
of battle (Od. Ι. 6. 14 ‘pulvere Troico Nigrum Merionen ’), not
to biting the ground in death, yet if ‘ audire ' means ‘to hear them
speaking,’ we should certainly have expected an epithet for ‘ duces,’
which should appeal to the ear rather than to the eye. Bentley
felt this difficulty, and wished to read, in despite of the MSS„
‘ videre.’ The point, which Orelli desiderates in our interpretation
of the verse, is possibly given by the fact (recorded by the elder
Seneca, Controv. 4 Praei), that ‘recitation' by an author of his
compositions‚ was a novel practice introduced by Pollio himself.

23. cuneta terrarum, Od. 4. 4. 76 ‘ acuta belli '; 4. 12. 19 ‘ amara
curarum’; Madv. § 284. obs. 3 n.

subacta, sc. a Caesare.

24. atrocem, ‘stubbom’ Silius, 6. 378‚of Regulus, ‘Atrox illa fides.²

Catonis, Od. 1. 12. 35 ‘ Catonis nobile letum.’ The mention of
Cato’s death, and the final overthrow of the Pompeians at Thapsus,
suggest the thought that Jugurtha is avenged in the Roman blood
shed on African soil. Similarly, and perhaps with remembrance of
this passage, Lucan 4. 788 foll. ‘ Excitet invisas dirae Carthaginis
umbras Inferiis Fortuna novis: ferat ista cruentus Hannibal et
Poeni tam dira piacula Manes.’ Orelli reminds us that the im-
pression which Jugurtha's cruel death (see on Od. 2. 13. 18) had
made on the Romans, had been revived by Sallust’s history.

25. Iuno, Virg. Aen. 1. 15. The Roman poets represent Juno
as a special patroness of Africa, identifying her with the Phoenician
goddess Astarte.

26. cesserat. So Virgil of the gods os the conquered city, Aen.
2. 351 ‘ Excessere omnes adytis arisque relictis Di quibus imperium
hoc steterat.² Cp. the story of the destruction of Jerusalem, Tac.
Hist. 5. 13 ‘ Exapertae repente delubri fores, et audita maior humana
vox, excedere deos; simul ingens motus excedentium.’

impotens, powerless to save their land from Rome.

29. pinguior, Virg. G. 1. 491 ‘ sanguine nostro Emathiam et latos

Haemi pinguescere campos.'
