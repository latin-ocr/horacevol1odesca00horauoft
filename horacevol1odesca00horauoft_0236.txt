THE ODES OF HORACE

Bassam-en, a name of Dionysus from βασσάρα, a Thracian word J

for a foxskin worn by the BacchantS. Horace puts ‘1 and those
who agree with me will be moderate in the use of wine‚’ into
language taken from the Bacchic mysteries. ‘I will not lay an
irreverent or untimely hand on thy rites.’

12. quatiam, properly applied to the thyrsus, and perhaps to
the solemn lifting of the sacred ‘cista,’ which contained the
emblems of the god, ‘commotis excita sacris Thyias,’ Virg. Aen.

variis, Theoc. 26. 3 gives a list of the leaves gathered by the ,

Bacchants, λασίας δρυ 205· ἄγρια φύλλα Ι κίσσον τε ζώοντα και ἀσφόδελον

tene'k‘lffssenoe', addressed still to Bacchus. ‘Do not excite us

Berecyntio, Od. 3. 19. 18 ‘Cur Berecyntiae cessant flamina -

tibiae?’ the horn used in Cybele’s worship on Mount Berecyntus

in Phrygia. It was also an accompaniment of the Bacchic orgies. “
Catuli, l. c. ‘Plangebant alii proceris tympana palmis, Multis Ξ

raucisonos efflabant cornua bombos!
14. caecae, a physical characteristic of the personified sels-love,
as Conington points out in a note on his translation.

15. plus nimio, Od. 1. 33. 1, Epp. 1. 10. 30. The order in prose Ξ
is ‘ nimio pluS‚’ Cic. ad Att. 10. 8. It has been explained: (1) as =
a translation of ὑπεράγαν, following the analogy of‘ plus iusto,’ &a ., '

‘ more than that which is too much’ ;)(2 as following the analogy

of‘ plus paulo’ (‘ a little too much ’) Ter. Heaut.2. 1. 8; ‘nimio
validius,' Plin.24.12; ‘nimio melius,’ Plaut. Pers. 1. 3. 31, ‘by ᾗ,
very much too much' ; ‘nimio’ being the ablative or adverb of
measure. It is a colloquial phrase common in Plautus, M. G. 2.
6. 106, Bacch. 1. 2. 42, and the combination in Bacch. 4. 4. 21 ·

‘nimio minus, multo parum,’ seems to show that the second ex-
planation was the true one3 see a collection of instances of‘ nimio'

with compar. adj. in Rainsay’s Mostellaria, Excursus 12. It Ξ
qualifies ‘ tollens, ’ ‘lifting far too high', · with this picture cp. Od. 3. ,ἐξ

16.17 ‘Iure perhorrui Late conspicuum tollere verticem!

Gloria, ‘vainglory,’ as in Epp. 1. 18. 22 ‘Gloria quem⁴ supra

vires et vestit et ungit.'
16. arcani Fides prodiga, an oxymoron, ‘Faith, that blabs out
her secret', · cp. Od. 3. 24. 59 ‘ periura· fides. ’
