THE EPODES OF HORACE

EPODE Ι

‘ YOU, Maecenas, are going to expose yourself to all the dangers
of war for Caesar's sake—what think you Ι shall do, to whom you
are as much as Caesar can be to you? I shall follow you to the
world’s end. Do you ask what good I can do? 1 shall be in less
terror if I am with you than if 1 am absent. I have no selfish'
motive. Your bounty has made me rich enough already. I don't
want more either to hoard or to squander.'

This Epode is usually referred (aster the Scholiast) to the spring
of Β. C. 31, when Octavianus according to Dion (50. 11), before
setting out to Actium, summoned the chief men of Rome, senators
and equites, to meet him at Brundisium: τοὺς μὲν ὅπως τι συμπρά-
ξωσιν αὐτῷ, τοὺς δ’ ὅπως· μηδὲν μονωθέντες νεοχμώσωσι, τό τε μέγιστον
ὅπως ενδείξηται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις“ οτι και τὸ πλεῖστον καὶ τὸ κράτιστον τῶν
Ῥωμαίων ὁμογνωμονοῦν ἔχοι. It would be probable that Maecenas
would go with the rest, even if he returned to Rome, as Dion (51 3)
speaks of his having been left m charge of Rome and Italy during
the campaign· ‚ but see Introd. to Epod. 9.

1. Liburnis, Od. 1. 37. 30, ships of a light build, modelled on
the piratical vessels of the Liburni, a tribe on the lllyrian coast.
They were the strength of Octavianus’ fleet at Actium.

alta propugnacula. ΙΙ the scene is Actium, these are the
wooden towers on Antony’s ships. Virg. Aen. 8. 691 ‘pelago
credas innare revulsas Cycladas aut montis concurrere montibus
altos, Tanta mole viri turritis puppibus instant. ’

4. tuo, sc. ‘periculo; ‘at your own perill

5. si superstite. Th'is was read by Porph„ who notices the
difficulty of construction, and gives the true explanation, viz. that
‘sit’ has to be understood both with‘ te superstite' and with

‘'contra, ‘if 1t be spent in thy lifetime) It is not harder than‘ ni
tecum simul' just below. A few MSS. omit‘ si‚’ leaving the verse
unmetrical, and some of the old editions have‘ sit.'

7. utrumne. Cicero has (pro Quinct. 30. 92)‘ utrum possitne se
. . . defendere . . . an . . . addicatur,' where the usage is logically
correct, ‘which of the two things? this? or that ?’ The coalescing
of the two words is poetical, and does not appear in prose writers
till the silver age. Horace uses ‘ne' with interrogatives more
. freely than other writers, e. g. ‘ uterne,' Sat. 2. 2. 1o7; ‘ quone‚' Sat.
2. 3. 295 ; ‘ quantane,‘ Sat. 2. 3. 317.

iussi, ‘ as you bid us.'
