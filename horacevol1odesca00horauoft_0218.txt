THE ODES OF HORACE

addressed to the second person. ‘ Hoc facit03 hoc ne feceris,’
Cic. Div. 2. 61, so Od. 1. 18. 1 ‘ nullam . . . severis arborem.’

3. numeros, ‘ tables,’ ‘ calculations,’ Juv. 6. 576. Cic. Div. 2. 47
‘rationes Chaldaeas.'

ut melius, ὅσῳ βέλτιον, ‘How much better is it! ' so in prose,
Cic. Mil. 24 ‘ Ut contempsit ac pro nihilo putavit,’ &c.

4. seu . . . seu. It is a question whether the apodosis is to be
looked for in ‘ut melius,’ &c., or in ‘sapias’ Perhaps the latter
is best, as avoiding an awkward break in the run of v. 6.

5. debilitat, breaks the force of, beats the waves on the rocks
till they are tired.

pumicibus, of any rocks ‘vesco sale peresa' (Lucr. 1. 326); so
Virg. Aen. 5. 214.

6. sapias, Od. 1. 7. 17.

liques, ‘ clear! This was done either with a linen strainer, or by
. other means, such as those described in Sat. 2. 4. 55.
spatio brevi, ‘ by the thought of the little span of life.⁹

7. dum loquimur, imitated by Pers. 5. 153 ‘ Vive memor leti: .·

fugit hora ; hoc quod loquor inde est.’

8. carpe diem. What is the metaphor? Is it of plucking a
flower; ‘velox Flosculus angustae miseraeque brevissima vitae
Portio‚' Juv. 9. 126? or perhaps rather (as Orelli) ‘snatch,' ἅρπαζε,
‘fugitiva ‚gaudia carpe,’ Mart. 7. 47. 11, ‘ catch them by the sleeve as
they run .

ODE XII

‘WHAT man wilt thou sing of, Clio? what demigod? what god?
—sing of, till the hill of Helicon rings his name again, or the woods
of Haemus follow to listen‚ as they did when Orpheus sang? What
god, but Jove first, and Pallas next, Liber, Diana, Phoebus. For
demigods, Hercules and the Twin Brethren who calm the stormy
sea. And of men: Romulus and all the Roman worthies; Marcellus,
the lustre of whose name grows with each generation3 the Julian
house, which outshines all others as the moon outshines the stars;
Caesar, the hope of the human race, the vicegerent of Jove himself.’

OlThe framework of the Ode is suggested by the opening of Pind.
. 2 :—

ἆναξιφόρμιγγες ὕμνοι
τίνα θεόν, τίν’ ἥρωα, τίνα δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδῆσομεν;

If we compare this Ode with the Second it carries Horace's

acceptance of the Caesarean regime a step further. That Ode

welcomes it as the end of civil war, this as the crown of Roman
history. The place given to Marcellus in the climax suggests a
special occasion and gives a limit of date to the Ode, see Introd.,to
Odes i—iii. ξ 2. It cannot have been written and can hardly have,
been published after his untimely death in the autumn of B.C. 23.
