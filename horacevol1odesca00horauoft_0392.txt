THE ODES ,OF HORACE

14-16. This is best illustrated by Caesar's description (B. G.
4.1) of the Suevi, from whom it is possible that Horace has trans·
ferred it to the Scythians. ‘ Suevi centum pagos habere dicuntur,
ex quibus quotannis singula milia armatorum bellandi causa ex
finibus educunt. Reliqui qui domi manserint se atque illos alunt.
Hi rursus invicem anno post in armis sunt, illi domi remanent.
Sic neque agricultura nec ratio atque usus bel'li intermittitur. Sed
privati ac separati agri apud eos nihil est3 neque longius anno
remanere uno in loco incolendi causa licet!

14. neo cultura placet, &c., seems therefore possibly to include
the two ideas that no individual was employed in tillage for more
than a year together, and that the same piece of ground was not
tilled for more than a year. ‘ None cares to till the soil for more
than a single year, ancl when one has fulfilled his toil a successor
relieves him on the same terms of service.'

16. aequali sorte, sc. for a year‘s turn.

vicarius, as Cicero calls Murena, the consul elect, ‘vicarium
diligentiae meae,’ Mur. 37.

17,18. ‘Holds her hands from harming her motherless step-
children.' For the use of ‘temperat ’ cp. Cic. Verr. 3. 59 ‘ Te putet
quisquam sociis temperasse ? ’ Ritter takes it, after the Schol., as
= ‘ pocula temperat,' ‘innocens ' implying that she mixes no poison
in the cup. There is no authority for the absolute use of ‘tem-
perare' in this sense.

19. dotata, on the strength of her dower. Plaut. Men. 5. 2. 16
⁴ Ita istaec solent quae viros subservire Sibi postulant dote fretae
feroces? Id. Aulul. 3. 5. 61 ‘ Nam quae indotata est ea in potestate
est viri3 Dotatae mactant et malo et damno viros.’ It. is constr.
with ⁴ regit‚' but not with ‘ fidit ’; cp. 2. 5. 13, 3. 23. 14.

19, 20. regit, fidit, the point is the inversion of lawful relations.

21. ⁴ The ample dower they bring is their parents’ worth,’ the
pure blopd and healthy traditions of virtuous households. Contrast

. 6. 1 o l.
3 226 {netuens alterius viri3 the gen. as ‘rixarum metuens,' 3.
19. 1 , q. v.

23. certo foedere3 1. 3. 18 ‘irrupta copula? It is one of

Horace’s abl. absol. (see on 2. 1. 12), neither exactly the abl. of the
ground of the action with ‘ metuens ’ nor the abl. of the quality with
⁴ castitas’: it adds a circumstance which completes and explains
both substantive and participle, ‘ the marriage bond was inviolable ἐ
‘ foedus,’ of the covenant of marriage3 cp. Virg. Aen. 4. 339 ‘ neque
haec in foedera veni.’

24. ‘They dare not sin, or if they sin they die,’ Conington. For
the constr. of ‘ nefas . . . aut ’ cp. 3. 12. 1, 2.

pretium, ποινή. The word does not necessarily imply either
reward or punishment. Juv. Sat. 13. 105 ‘ Ille crucem sceleris
pretium tulit, hic diadema!

25. It appears from Porph. that in his time some copies marked
the beginning of a new Ode here, for he condemns such a division.
See on Od. 1. 7. 15 and Epod. 2. 23.
