ODE I

‘ MEN have different ideas of glory and happiness—success in the
Olympic games, civic honours, wealth. The farmer will not turn
trader sor any prospect of riches, nor the trader give up the sea for
any danger. One likes a life of ease; another the excitements of
war or sport. My taste is lyric poetry, and my glory that you
should rank me with the lyric poets of Greece.’

The Ode is clearly written as an introduction‚ and there is in it
some irony. (Cp. the tone of Od. 3. 30, when the work is done.)
It is addressed to Maecenas, as is the first of the Epodes, the first
of the Satires, the first of Book i of the Epistles ; and so, like them,
it serves as a dedication. -

Compare also Od. 4. 3, which recalls the main thoughts of this
Ode, though its confident tone and the absence of a patron’s name
point the change which had by that time come upon the poet’s cir-
cumstances. There is no need in either Ode to trace the ‘incon-
gruous ’ mention of the Olympic games as among the natural objects
of ambgtion to the remembrance of any special Greek original, such
as Pin . Fr. 2012-

The purpose is to give the feeling of a wide survey of human life,
and Horace does not draw a strong line between the Greek life
which survived in literature and the actual Roman life of his own
day. The apology for poetry, as one among the various tastes of
mankind, is as old at least as Solon (2. 43—52)‚ and Horace would
remember the end of Virg. G. 2, esp. vv. 503 foll. For the same

. thoughts in a less poetical form, cp. Sat. 2. Ι. 27 foll. ‘ Quot capitum

vivunt', totidem studiorum Milia: me pedibus delectat claudere
veleashogizifd be noticed that, though Horace seems to be only apolo-
gizing for his own pursuit of writing poetry, as not more unaccount-
able than the many others which divide mankind, yet, when he
