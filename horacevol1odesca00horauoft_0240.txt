THE ODES OF HORACE

ODE XXI

COMPARE Catull. 34 ‘ Dianae sumus in fide,' &c-

Several occasions have been imagined for this Ode. The Pseudo.-
Acr. associated it with the Ludi Saeculares, B.c. 17, and it was
accordingly treated by several editors as an introduction to the
Carm. Saec.

Franke assigns it to B. C. 28, the year in which Augustus dedi·
cated the temple to Apollo on the Palatine (Od. 1. 31), and instituted
the quinquennial Ludi Actiaci in honour of Apollo and Diana. He
thinks the ode was written for their first celebration.

It is more probably an exercise of fancy, suggested perhaps by ¹
some such occasion as the games of B.C. 28. It is hardly of weight ,

enough to have been composed sor public performance, and Horace
was not prominent enough at that date to have been selected, as
he was in B.C. 17, to write such an Ode.

1. Dianam. The first syllable is long, as once in Virg. Aen.
139 intonsum, Epod. 15. 9, Hom. Il. 20. 39 Φοῖβος ἀκερσεκόμης.
It is the sign of youth. The maidens are to sing Diana, the maid

Notice Horace's way of distributing the epithets, ‘tenerae' with ''-
‘virgines,' ‘intonsum' with ‘ Cynthium‚’ both implying that the ’

choir is as the god it addresses.
Cynthium, from Mt. Cynthus in Delos.

3. Latonam, as the mother of the two deities. Cp. Hymn. in
Apoll. 14 χαῖρε μάκαιρ’ ὦ Λητοῖ ἐπεὶ τέκες ἅγλαα τέκνα. It is probably 5
meant that both choruses should join in her praise ; cp. Od. 3. 28.

9—16. He returns to the maidens in v. 5 ‘ vos.’

5. laetam fluviis, asin Catull. 34. 5 ‘ Montium domina ut fores 3
Silvarumque virentium Saltuumque reconditorum Amniumque ῗ

sonantium’; Pind. P. 2. 7 ποταμίας Ἀρτέμιδος.

coma. The best MSS. give ‘comam,’ which Acron seems to .'
have read and tried, against the sense, to take with ‘laetam ”

fluviis.’ Bentley defends it as setting off the woods of Algidus,

ξ

&c. against Tempe and Delos, and ‘laetam fluviis’ against the ἓ
‘insignem pharetra umerum’ of the next stanza. But Horace Ξ
would hardly have tolerated the ambiguity of ‘ laetam ’ not agree·- ς

ing with ‘comam,' yet without a visible substantive of its own. ’,ς
And though it is a natural hyperbole to speak of Diana’s joy in ‘¹'

‘every leaf of the woodS,' it would be forced to bid the maidens
sing of each leaf.

6. Algido, sacred to Diana3 C. S. 69 ‘Quaeque Aventinum ἶ
tenet Algidumque.' ‘Mons Algidus' was the name of part of the '2
eastern side of the Alban hills. Its name is supposed to be still
