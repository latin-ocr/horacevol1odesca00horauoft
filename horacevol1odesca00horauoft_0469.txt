2. 1. 23 ‘ Turbaque vernarum saturi bona signa coloni.' Cp. Martial's
description of F austinus’ villa, 3. 58. 22 ‘ Cingunt serenum lactei
focum vernae Et larga festos· lucet ad Lares silva.' The ‘focus ' is
in the middle of the ‘atrium,' the images of the Lares near it,
glowing brightly with the blaze, and the slaves, all born on the
estate, are gathered round it.

69. redegit. Bentley shows by a large collection of instances,
chiefly from Cicero, that this was the usual word for calling in
. money that had been let or was otherwise due.

70. Kalendis = before a month is out. The Kalends, Ides, and
Nones were all days of settlement. Cic. Verr. 2. Ι. 57 ‘Nemo
Rabonio molestus est neque Kalendis Decembribus neque Nonis
neque Idibus.’ Compare for the Ides Sat. 1. 6. 75, where they are
the monthly pay· day at schools, and for the Kalends Sat. 1. 3. 87
‘Qui nisi, cum tristes misero venere Kalendae, Mercedem aut
nummos unde unde extricatss διο. Interest at Rome was calculated
b the month.

yponerf, to ‘lend' it again. A. P. 421 ‘dives positis in faenore

EPODE III

A MOCK heroic invective against garlic. Horace has eaten some
dish seasoned with it at Maecenas’ table, and he treats it as
a practical joke of his host’s (v. 20 ‘iocose Maecenas ’). ‘Garlic
should be substituted for hemlock in the punishment of parricides.
What can the reapers’ stomachs be made of? He has taken
poison—viper's blood, some decoction of Canidia's—the very drug
which Medea used to prevent the bulls touching Jason, and to
destroy Creusa. The heat of Apulia in the dog-days, of Hercules‘
fiery garment, was nothing to it. If Maecenas has the bad taste to
have such a dish again, may he be rewarded by finding that he cannot
get a kiss if he wishes it.’

Compare the commencement of Od. 2. 13.

1. olim. The development according to the context, from an
Original meaning ‘at that time,' i. e. ‘not at this time,' of the definite
meanings ‘at a past time' (as Od.3. 11. 5‘nec loquax ol1m ’) and

‘at a future tirne' (as Od. 2. 10. 17‘ non, si male nunc, et olim Sic
erit ²), as well as the colourless meaning ‘at any time,'‘ ever '(as m
this place· , cp. Sat. 1. 1. 25 ‘ut pueris olim dant crustula blandi
Doctores‚' Epp. 1. 10. 42, &c.), affords a good illustration of the
general history of particles the most· definite in their eventual
meaning, such as ‘dum,' ‘nam‚’ and even the negatives; it also
illustrates the various uses of the Greek aorist.

3. edit, an archaic form of the subjunctive3 Sat. 2. 8. 90.

4. messorum, for it was a usual ingredient in their messes;
