THE ODES OF HORACE ἲ

drifting back into the storm. The masts, the sails‚ the pine of
Pontus, the Cyclades, belong to the ship, and we must not look for
their exact counterparts in the State. Here, as with other alle- '
gories, we are beset with difficulties the moment we attempt to
fit the details more exactly. It has been argued, for instance, τ
from vv. 17, 18, that· Horace speaks of the ship as if he had himself
left it (but see notes on those verses), and that the subject of the
Ode must, therefore, be not the State but the Republican party.
Why, others ask, is it a Pontic pine, not some other—Idean‚ per-
haps, as more suitable to the mythical origin of Rome? Acron

Mithridates of Pontus. The ship, therefore, represents the fortunes
of his son, Sextus Pompeius, whom Horace would dissuade from
embarking again in war with Octavianus after the treaty of Misenum,
Β. C. 39. This view, if there were no other reason against it, would -
carry the Ode into the time of the earliest EpodeS.

The difficulties of interpretation seemed so great to Muretus,
Dacier, and Bentley, that they refused to allow the Ode to be ’
allegorica] at all.

On our view there will be nothing to fix it to a definite date. =
The ship is in sight of harbour. This distinguishes the Ode from ..2
Epodes 7 and 16 (see the Introductions to them). It is not yet ᾗ
moored beyond the reach of the wind. So long as the most timid ῃ
politician could see in any movement a thought of renewed resis- ’
tance to the rule which had saved Rome from anarchy‚ so long , .-
might Horace have vented his fears, or appealed to the fears of '.
others by this allegory.

A more plausible suggestion of Torrentius, which Franke adopts, J
finds an occasion for the Ode in B.C. 29, when AugustuS‚ according ,ξ
to the statement both of Suetonius (Oct. 28) ancl of Dion (52. 1), ,
entertained the thought of abandoning the supreme power which > .'
had just fully come into his hands. Dion gives a speech of ·
Maecenas on that occasion, in which he uses the very allegory 1 ⁷
of the Ode. It is however certain that Horace drew his image,
not from any speech of Maecenas, but from Alcaeus. Dion may g
more probably have taken it from Horace. ξ

The image of a ship for the State is an old one. See, inter alia,
Aesch. Sept. c. T. 1, Soph. O. T. 25, Plat. Rep. p. 488, Theognis,

the State, who are battling with the waves.
