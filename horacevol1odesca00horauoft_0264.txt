THE ODES OF HORACE

of 1. 223 each centering round a circumstance in the poet’s personal ,

experience. This in both cases stands in the middle of the Ode,

introduced by the emphatic ‘ namque ’ (1. 22. 9): it is the ground of ’-

the statements that precede and follow. What he has witnessed in
this case, and the cause to which alone he can trace it, justify both

the general recantation of stanza 1, and the solution which he gives ·

in stanza 4 of the difficulty in the human world which seems to him
analogous to the thunder, for which no ‘ secondary cause' was to be
found, in the material world.

1. pareus refers to offerings‚ frequens to attendance. Cp. the
t()]13rpc⁴>‡sit1e⁵ ‘[Dernosthenes] frequens fuit Platonis auditor.’ Cic.

2. insanientis sapientiae, σοφίας ἀσόφου; the oxymoron is con· ·
tinued in ‘ consultus erro ἐ σοφία or ‘ sapientia ' is the special name ³

that Lucretius claims for the Epicurean system, ‘vitae rationem . . . “
eam quae nunc appellatur sapientia,’ 5. 10, cp. 2. 7 ‘doctrina
sapientum.’

3. consultUS, as used commonly with ‘ iuris,’ meant one whose

opinion was sought, and so an adept, a professor. Livy had led J
the way in transferring it to other arts‚ ‘iuris atque eloquentiae Γ

consultus,’ 10. 22. .

4. iterare cursus relictos, ‘to steer again in the course I had ·.'
deserted,' i.e. to return to the ways of thought to which I was ·
accustomed before 1 learnt Epicureanism. Bentley, disliking the ν

expression ‘ relinquere cursus’ (‘ relinquere viam ' he thinks would ,
be right, but ‘intermittere cursum')‚ and attracted by the frequent ⁸
use by the later poets of ‘relegere’ with ‘cursus,’ ‘viam,’ &c. ζ
(cp. Virg. Aen. 3. 690 ‘relegens errata retrorsum Litora ’)‚ wished f

to read, ex mera coniectura, ‘ relectos,’ which would be predicative,
‘ to retrace and travel again,’ ἃς.

5. Diespiter, a religious archaism, affected by Horace again
in Od. 3. 2. 29: cp. Varr. L. L. 5. 66 ‘antiquius Iovis nomen: nam
olim Diovis et Diespiter dictus, id est dies pater.' So A. Gell.
6. 12 ‘Iovis Diespater appellatus est, id est, diei et lucis pater,' and
Macr. Saturn. 2. 15. It is connected by them with the name '.
‘Lucetius,' given to him in the hymns of the Salii. It occurs
probably in the formula of the Fetiales‚ Liv. 1. 24 (see Seeley’s
note). On the etymology see Corssen, Aussprache, 1. 233: he ν
refuses to allow the composition of a Latin word by means of ³

a genitive case, and therefore sees in Dies· a form of the stem

which also appears in the Greek εὒ-διέσ-τερος, and ‘ with the Latin
change of s to r’ in ‘ho-dier-nus.' .

7. plerumque. All the older commentators who notice the ζ’
point join ‘ plerumque‘ with ‘egit,' not perceiving that Horace is ξ
speaking of a single instance in his own experience. For the ⁷
emphatic position of ‘plerumque' at the end of its clause Bentl.
compares Epp. 2. 2. 84 and Lucr. 5. 1131.

purum, the cloudless sky: ‘ sole puro,’ Od. 3. 29. 45, cp. 3. 10. 8.
