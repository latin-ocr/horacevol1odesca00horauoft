THE ODES OF HORACE ἲ

31. Hom. Il. 5. 186 νεφέλῃ εἰλυμένος ὤμους, veiling his brightness ’
that mortals might look upon him.

32. augur. Apollo (μάντις Διὸς προφήτης)- R-omanized as the ⁴
god of augury, Virg. Aen. 4. 376—may tell them how the pollution ᾗ
is to be removed. ,

33. Erycina, ‘Venusss from her temple on Mount Eryx in Sicily, f
Virg. Aen. 5. 759. The people of Segesta applied to Tiberius to ‘³
restore this temple on the ground of its mythical connexion with 3·
the founder of the Julian gens, and he‘ suscepit curam libens ut ἰ
consanguineus,’ Tac. Ann. 4. 43.

ridens, φιλομμειδὴς.

35. genus et nepotes, === ‘genus nepotum‚’ Od. 3. 17. 3. The ⁷
purpose of the hendiadys is to give full emphasis to ‘neglectum ’ ''
and to ⁴ auctor' by allowing each a clause to itself. μ

36. auctor. Mars, the father of Romulus and Remus; Virg. Ξ
Aen. 4. 365⁴ generis nec Dardanus auctor! ς

37. ludo, war is the sport of Mars (see on Od. 1.28. 17) as the ,ἱ
turns of luck are the sport of F ortune Od. 3. 29. 50, lovers’ miseries ²
and errors of Venus and Cupid, 1. 33. 10, 3. 27. 67.

39. Mauri. This is the reading of all the MSS. and of Acr. τῇ
and Porph. Faber conjectured‘ Marsi,’ and Bentley argues at 'j
length for it on the ground that the ‘ Mauri' were ‘nec fortes, nec '
pedites, nec cominus pugnantes? But it is ferocity, not courage, j
which is in question; and we learn from Sall. Jug. 59, that the
Numidae at least had learnt at this time to mingle foot soldiers
amongst their cavalry. The Romans had done this in the Punic
War (Liv. 26. 4), and Caesar reports the same practice among the
Gauls and the Germans (Β. G. 1. 48, 7. 80).

cruentum, ‘ bleeding.’

41-43. ‘Or if thou be sweet Maia’s winged child wearing on
earth the disguise of human youth.'

41. iuvenem, Virg. E. 1. 43 ‘Hic illum vidi iuvenem’3 G. 1.
500 ⁶ Hunc saltem everso iuvenem succurrere saeclo Ne prohibete. ’

44. Caesaris ultor. Dion 53. 4 makes Augustus assert that his
mission had been τῷ πατρὶ δεινῶς σφαγέντι τιμωρῆσαι, and the
temple of Mars Ultor, of which the sacade still stands 1n the Forum
Augusti, was built in fulfilment of a vow made by him, ‘bello
Philippensi pro ultione paterna suscepto? Suet. Oct. 29; cp. Ov.
Fast. 5. 569.

45- 5ο. Cp. Virg. G. 1. 503 ‘Iampridem nobis caeli te regia,
Caesar, Invidet atque hominum queritur curare triumphOS‚ Quippe
ubi fas versum atque nefas,’ διε.

47. nostris vitiis iniquum, ‘intolerant of,’ ‘non diutius aequa
mente vitia ferentem!

48. aura tollat, keeps up the character of the winged Mercury,
ever ‘on tip-toe' for flight.

49. triumphos. ‘Caesar triplici invectus Romana triumpho
Moenia‚’ Virg. Aen 8. 714; ‘Curulis triumphos tres egit, Dalmati-
cum, Actiacum, Alexandrinum: continuo triduo omnis, ‘ Suet.
