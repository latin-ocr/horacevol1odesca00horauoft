one. Another point of some interest has been supposed to be
involved in the date of Tiridates’ flight. Two os the Odes which
refer to this event (3. 8 and 29) speak also of Maecenas as burdened
with cares of State in a way in which no other Ode speaks os him.
‘Mitte civilis super urbe curaS‚' ‘Tu civitatem quis deceat status
Cui-as, et urbi sollicitus times.' These expressions have been
usually interpreted of the powers which Augustus is known to have
delegated to Maecenas during his own absence from Rome in the
last year of the civil war. Dion 51. 3, Tac. Ann. 6. 11 ‘Augustus
bellis civilibus Cilnium Maecenatem equestris ordinis cunctis apud
Romam {tque Italiam praeposuit! If the later date of these Odes
were adopted it would seem necessary to assume, what is probable
enough in itself, but not otherwise ascertained‚ that the same
powers were entrusted to Maecenas during Augustus’ absence in
Gaul and Spain in the years Β. c. 27—24.

II.—THE ORDER OF THE ODES, AND ·THEIR
DIVISION INTO THREE BOOKS.

ξ 9. In the preceding pages Ῑ have assumed the correctness of
the traditional view that Books i—iii form a unity. How far parti-
cular Odes or groups of Odes may have been shown to friends or
given wider publicity before the whole collection was complete, it is
of course beyond our power to guess: but we vmean that the three
Books were arranged as we have them by Horace himself, at one
time, and intended to be read as a whole.

ξ 10. This can hardly be said to rest on external evidence, sor
although the words of Suetonius, ‘ tribus carminum libris ex longo
intervallo quartum addere‚' lend themselves to the idea of such
a substantial unity of the earlier Books, they do not necessitate it 3
but the internal evidence in its favour is very strong. In other
cases where Horace’s poems are divided into ‘Books,' there is
a corresponding difference of personal and historical background
which explains the division: these three ‘ Books' reflect the same
time; all their references to persons and events point, as we have
seen,.to a single period of about seven years. Whatever be their
