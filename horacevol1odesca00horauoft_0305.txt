the man that planted the tree, 5ο that ‘ ille ’ stands fitly in the place ’
of emphasis 1n both stanzas. ‘ Quicumque primum ’has increased
force for its parenthetical position3 ·—‘ I don' t know who he was οι
how long ago it was (the tree had fallen from its age), but I can tell
for certain the character both of the man and of the day of his deed?
nefasto,‘ of ill omen.’ N efasti dies’ were properly the opposite

, of ‘ fasti,’ ‘ days on which the Praetor did not sit,’ ‘ unlawful days?

All days on which the courts were closed were therefore equally

‘nefasti'; but by an error whichA. Gellius notices (Noct. Att. 4. 9),
the epithet was vulgarly restricted to those which were interdicted
for business as ‘tristi omine infames) In the poets and post- Aug.
prose ‘’nefastus came to be used as equivalent to ‘nefarius‚' as

2. sacrilega, generalized as osten. ‘impious. ²

3. produxit, ‘'reared z—the verb is used of educating children

which is to be looked for in ‘sacrilega manu,' just as the verb is
varied again in v. 10 to‘ statuit,' which has to carry ‘in meo agro.²

in perniciem, ‘ to be the destruction‚’ as ‘iuvenescit . . . in mea
-vota‚’ ‘to pay my vow,’ 4. 2. 563 ‘in classem cadit omne nemus‚’
‘ to form the fleet,’ Luc. 1. 306. ‘

5. crediderim, cp. Sat. 1. 5. 44 ‘contulerim’ The subjunctive
of the futurum exactum (Madv. § 380) used ln modest statements of
possible things, ‘I shall be likely to believe,' ‘1 could well believe!

6. fregisse cervicem, Epod.3.1 ‘Parentis olim si quis impia
manu Senile guttur fregerit'3 Sall. Cat. 55 ‘Frangere gulam laqueo?

8. Colcha, poisons such as Medea used, Epod. 3.9‚ 17. 35. The
good MSS. are divided between ‘ Colcha' and‘C01ehica: 1f we

· read the first it is the only instance of the collision osa short open

vowel at the end of one Alcaic stanza and a vowel at the commence-
ment of the next. If the latter, it is the only instance of continuous
scansion between Alcaic stanzas. Horace more commonly prefers
the gentile form to the possessive, ‘ Maura unda,' ‘ Italo caelo,' δια,

10. tractavit, for the slight zeugma in ‘tractare venena et nefas‚’
cp. 1. 15. 12 ‘aegida currumque et rabiem parat.'
’ 11. caducum,‘ ea natura ut caderes, see on 3. 4. 44.
13. ‘What special danger each should avoid, man is never fore-

’“ warned from hour to hour as he had need be.‘

15. Poenus. So the MSS. and the Schol. without exception· ,
but it is difficult to see the special relation between ‘Poenus’ and
‘ Bosporum! ‘ Aut Bosporum pro quolibet freto dixit aut Poenum
pro quolibet nauta3 multum enim divisus est Poenus a Bosporo,’
Aer. The suggestion, endorsed by Orelli, that‘ Poenus' can be
used for‘ Phoenician,' i. e. ‘Tyrian,’ requires proof. That the two
· words are etymologically identical is an argument, as Munro
remarks, which would equally show that‘ Yankees’ might now be
used convertibly with ‘English,’ of which it was originally an Indian
