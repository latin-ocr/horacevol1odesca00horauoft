THE ODES OF HORACE

23. taciturnitas invida; cp. 4. 9. 33 ‘lividas obliviones! ἔρ

Verses are quoted from Ennius in honour of Romulus; but the
thought is not limited to any particular poem. ‘ Rome itself‚ with
all its greatness and history, would not tell us who Romulus was
unless poetry kept the legend alive?

26. virtus, generally taken of the poet’s power; but it is perhaps '3
better to take it of Aeacus z ‘ His virtue, yes, and the goodwill and ε·
the tongue of poets.² ‘ Et . . . et' will imply that the last conditions “
are at least as necessary as the first3 their reinforcement by the
epithet ‘potentium,' ‘who can do so if they will,’ give them pre- “

eminent importance. Aeacus’ merits‚ like Romulus’ birth, only
heighten our sense of the poet’s power, in that without it even they
would have been powerless. ’

27. insulis, the local abl. : ‘ divitibus,' Epod. 16. 423 ὀλβίαις . . .
μακάρων νήσοις. ’

28. He gathers the moral of the preceding instances. The Muse
does not only protect her favourites from death, she also confers on
them a place in heaven. The illustrations are the same as in 3. 3.

30. optatis, he has attained his wishes: ‘Enisus arces attigit
igneas?

31. Cp. 1. 3. 2, 1. 12. 27.

33. This line has been suspected on account of its similarity to 3.
2 5. 20 ⁴ Cingentem viridi tempora pampino ’; but ‘ Liber ' (as Orelli
remarks) would stand baldly with no qualifying clause. It means
‘as a god,’ ‘in the insignia by which we always recognize him.’

ODE IX

‘ Do not despise the office of the lyric poet, Lollius. Pindar’s ⁴
poems live, unextinguished by Homer’s greater name3 and so do
those of Simonides, Alcaeus, Stesichorus, Anacreon, Sappho.
Before Homer sang, many a Helen loved, many a Troy was
besieged, many a Hector or Deiphobus fought and died for wife
and children. Why are they unwept, unknown? Because they

had no inspired chronicler; and, when once forgotten, what good ,
is left of their heroism? It shall not be so with you, Lollius, if <
I can help it. You have the mind of a statesman—clear sighted‚ '

well balanced, proof against avarice‚ ruler of all things, because it

rules itself‚ Such is the one wise and happy man, who is inde· “

pendent of circumstances, who can use prosperity well, and not
shrink from poverty or death in a good cause.’

Lollius (⁶ M. Lollius M. F.’ His cognomen is unknown; see on
Epp. 1. 2.1) had been consul 13.C. 21 (Epp. 1. 20. 28). For his
