rescued you? What limits can we set to our gratitude or to our
rejoicing?’ ‘'Redonare is a word only found in Horace, see
Οέιῗίτὲθιξιῖί ‘a full Roman citizen' ; ‘capite non deminutum.
Dill¹'., Orelli, Ritter. Conington in his Translation takes it as opp.
to ‘miles,’ ‘a man of peace,' supporting it by the story of Julius
Caesar reducing the mutinous loth legion to order by addressing
them as ‘ Quirites,’ the term implying that they were disbanded,

prime, ‘praecipue,' Aer. Ritter would interpret it ‘earliest,

Ι objecting that Pompeius would not be ranked before Varius, Virgil,

Maecenas, &c.; but Horace is thinking only of the old days of
their acquaintance in the camp, when Pompeius may well have

3 been the‘ chiefest of his companions.'

6. morantem fregi, see on 1. 1. 20. This can hardly have been
during the actual campaign in Macedonia, but it is probable that
Horace, while in Brutus’ army, was in Asia3 see Milman’s Life of
Horace, p. 17, and Introd. to Sat. 1. 7, and Epp. Ι. 11.

7. coronatus nitentis, ‘with a garland on my hair glistening
with Syrian persume! ‘Dat et Malobathron Syria, arborem folio
convoluto arido colore: ex quo exprimitur oleum ad unguenta, ’
Plin. N. H. 12. 59.

10. non bene3 there is the same irony in the dimin. parmula,

‘my poor little shield'3 cp. Epod. 1.16‘Imbellis ac firmus
parum, 'and contrast Epp. 1. 20. 23 ‘Me primis urbis belli placuisse

g domique.’ That Horace should have been able playfully to impute
cowardice to himself is enough, as Lessing pointed out, to prove
·“ that he had no sear that others would impute it to him. He is

11. eum fra-eta virtus. Of his own share in the campaign the
poet professes to remember only the stolen holidays of carousing,
the dropped shield and flig ht, but this gives greater force to the
few words' in which he speaks of the fall of the cause for which he
fought. He seems to say, ‘ What could Ῑ do when Manhood’s self

broke, and those who threatened so high bit the dust in defeat. 2'

Horace heartily embraced the cause of Octavianus, and put his
muse at his patr'on 5 service, but he was not expected to revile the

- party he had left, cp 1. 12. 35. Orelli suggests that there is

a reminiscence of Brutus’ last words, Ὠ τλῆμον ἀρετή, λόγος’Ι ap ἧ’σθ’,

ἐγὼ δέ σε Ι ὡς ἔργον ησκουν, Dion 47. 49.
