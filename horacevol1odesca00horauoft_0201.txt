BOOK 1, ODE 111, 1-9

deo’; 1. 6. 10 ‘musa lyrae potens) He is addressing Venus
³ (‘marina‚' Od. 3. 26. 5, 4. 11. 15); she was worshipped at Cnidus

under the name of εὔπλοια, Paus. 1. 1. 4. Cp. Ov. Her. 19. 160
‘Auso Venus' ipsa favebit, Sternet et aequoreas aequore nata vias)

2. fratres Helenae, ‘Castor and Pollux? Od. 4. 8. 31 ‘Clarum
Tyndaridae sidus ab infimis Quassas eripiunt aequoribus ratis!
Cp. 1. 12. 25 foll„ 3. 29. 64. They were especial protectors of
sailors, who saw their presence in the electric lights which are
’ said to play about the spars of a vessel at times after stormy
weather m the Mediterranean, and which are now called St. Elmo’ s
fire. It is these, and not the constellation Gemini, that are the
‘lucida sidera) Cp. Statius Pro. Met Cel. 8 ‘Proferte benigna
Sidera, et antennae gemino considite cornu?

3. regat, for the number, see on v. 10.

pater, ‘ Aeolus,’ from Hom. Od. 10. 21 ; cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 52.

4. aliis, ‘all others,’ cp. Sat. 1. 10. 77, an uncommon use, but
found even in good prose3 ‘vulgus aliud trucidatum,’ Liv. 7. 19.
Itlis plerhgps rather in its sense of ἀλλοῖος than of ἄλλος, ‘ those of
ot er in s.'

Iapyga, ‘albus Iapyx,’ Od. 3. 27. 20. The N.W. wind, which
got its name in the mouths of those who crossed from Brundisium
to Dyrrhachium, on whom it blew from the ‘ Iapygium Promonto-
rium ’ in Apulia, and to whom it was the most favourable wind.

6. finibus Atticis, ‘ ambiguum utrum “ debes finibus Atticis ’⁹ an
“finibus Atticis reddas,” ’ Porph. It is really governed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ,
as grammarians say, by both. This is a construction which Horace
often adopts for the sake of brevity, and to avoid clumsy and
unmanageable pronouns and particles. Compare the position oi
‘consiliis ’ in Od. 2. 11. 11 ; of ‘ sibi’ in 3. 8. 19; of ‘ cantare ’ in Sat.
1. 3. 2. The metaphor of a ‘depositum’ (Statius Silv. 3. 2. 5 ‘Grande
tuo rarumque damus, Neptune, profundo Depositum ') is sustained

ι through the words‘ creditum,'‘ debes,’ ‘’reddas ;with‘ incolumem'

the ‘safety’ of Virgil becomes again more prominent than the
‘entireness’ of the repayment.

8. et, ‘and so.' It couples two descriptions of the same action,
first in its relation to Virgil, then in its relation to Horace, cp. 2. 2.

- ἐστὶ μία ψυχὴ’ εν δυοῖν σώμασιν, ’Porph.; Call. Ep. 43 ἥμισυ μευ ψυχῆς

’ ἔτι τὸ πνέον,ἡ’μισυ δὀὐκ οἷδ’ Ι εἴτ’ ’Ἔρος εντ’ Ἀΐδης” ηρπασε, πλην ἀφανές.
Cp. Od. 2. 17. 5 ‘te meae partem animae?

9. robur et aes triplex. The original of this and other ex-
pressioris of the kind is the Homeric σιδήρεος θυμός, Il. 21. 357· ,
σιδήρειον ἦτορ, 24. 205. Jani took the words as= ‘robur aeris
triplicis,' quoting Virg. Aen. 7. 609‘ aeternaque robora ferri? But
the accumulation ‘oak and triple brass’ is like Aesch. P. V. 244
σιδηρόφρων τε κάκ πέτρας εἷργασμένοςί cp. Od. 3. 16. 2 ‘turris aenea
Robustaeque fores! >It is common both in Greek and Latin to
put the two things conjunctively, rather than as alternatives; cp.
