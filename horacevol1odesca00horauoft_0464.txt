THE EPODES OF HORACE

9. Best taken with Nauck, ‘An hunc laborem [persequemur],
laturi [eum] mente‚' &c. Η5 points out that‘ feremus' answers
the question of ‘ laturi,’ ‘sequemur' (v. 14) of ‘Jpersequemur
Others make ‘ laturi’= ‘laturi sumu5,’ the verb of the sentence.

12. inhospitalem Caucasum, Od. 1. 22. 6.

13. sinum, Virg. G. 2. 123 ‘extremi sinus orbis‚' where see
Conington. It would seem here to mean the last winding of the
shore as it trends westward towards the Atlantic‚ so that it is the
eq nivalent of‘ Gades’ in Od. 2. 6. 1.

q.16 See on Od. 2. 7. 10.

19. adsidens, of the general time when she has a callow brood,
for at the moment, ex hypothesz, she has left them.

21. ut adsit,‘ even supposing she were present? Madvig. L. G.
§ 44oa, obs. 4, so Cic. pro Mil. 17. 46 ‘ Ut enim neminem alium nisi
T. Patinam familiarissimum suum rogasset, scire potuit, '&.,c and so
also, if the subjunctive be read there, Mur. 34. 71‘ si ut suffragentur
nihil valent gratia.' Bentley, objecting to the tautology of‘ ut adsit

. . praesentibus,’ would adopt ⁴ uti sit,' ‘non uti’ being=‘non quo,’
‘not that she could give,' &c. This was the reading of one of
Cruquius’ MSS., and he draws support for it from the unmetrical
‘ut sit' which is found in several good MSS. The vulg. was inter—
preted by Porph. Orelli suggests that the tautology is of a kind
rather affected by Latin writers, e. g. Ter. Ad. 4. 5. 34 ‘ cum hanc
sibi videbit praesens praesenti eripi!

623. militabitur bellum, as ‘ pugnata bella,’ Od. 3. 19. 4, Epp. 1.
1 . 2 .

24.5111 spem, ⁴ to further my hope,' as ‘in honorem,’ Od. 1. 7. 8.

gratiae is opposed to the more sordid objects which are re-
pudiated in the following lines.

25—28. Compare the imagined objects of prayer in Od. 1. 31.
3 foll. ‘Non opimae Sardiniae segetes feraces, Non aestuosae grata
Calabriae Armenta! Cp. Epp. 2. 2. 177, in a similar connexion,
‘ Calabris Saltibus adiecti Lucani’

26. nitantur, ‘s3truggle ‘aratris nisus poetice tribuitur qui
proprie boum est,' Orelli.

mea.. The best MSS. have‘ meis, 'but the copyists seem to
have got into confusion between the terminations of 26, 28, and 3o;

‘’pascua dividing the older MSS. pretty equally with‘ pascuis.
Sound and the balance of the adJ'ective between‘ iuvencis' and
‘’aratra are in favour of the nominative which is given by Orelli,
Dill., and Munro; Keller and Kiessling have‘ meis.’

27. Orelli quotes Varro R. R. 2. 1. 16‘ greges ovium longe
abiguntur ex Apulia 111 Samnium aestivatum,’ and ib. 2. 2. 9 ‘mihi
greges in Apulia hibernabant qui in Reatinis montibus aestivabant?
For the construction of‘ mutet’ see Od.1.17. 2.

T 29.1‘Nor that 1 may have a country house on the outskirts of
uscu um

superni describes its situation, crowning the Eastem summit
of the Alban hills above the modern Frascati.
