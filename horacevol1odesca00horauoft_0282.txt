THE ODES OF HORACE

and the brother of Maecenas’ wife Terentia, we know from Dion
54. 3. Proculeius was high 1n Augustus' favour3 so much 5ο, that
he is named as one of the persons to whom at different times the
emperor had thought of marrying his daughter Julia (Tac. Ann. 4.
40). Juvenal (7. 94) couples him with Maecenas as a patron of
literature.

5. vivet extento aevo, ‘ shall live beyond the term of life.’ Cp. ¹
Virg. Aen. ιο. 468‘ breve et irreparabile tempus Omnibus est vitae;
secl famam extendere factis Hoc virtutis opus?

6. notus animi, imitated by Statius Theb. 2. 274‘ noti operum!
The Greek gen. of relation avoids the awkwardness of a preposition,

‘notus propter’ or ‘’ob. With‘ in fratres paterni’ cp. Od. 4. 4. 27
‘paternus In pueros animus Nerones! Cp. also Cic. Rosc. Am.
16. 46 ‘animus patrius in liberos.'

7. aget, ‘ will carry on his way,’ will not allow him to fail, as he
‘ volitat vivus per ora virum.’ ·

metuente solvi, ‘that dare not droop‚’ ‘is shy of drooping.’
Od. 3. 11. 10, 4. 5. 20. Virgil had the expression first, G. 1. 246

‘Arctos metuentis aequore tingi!

solvi, like Virgil's‘ solvi membra? λι εσθαι οι· possibly, as
Ritter suggests, with a remembrance of Icarus’ fate, whose wings
were fastened with wax and melted in the sun. Cp. in a similar
πιεῖειρῑιὸτὲεαὶ description of posthumous fame,‘ Daedaleo notior
Icaro ' . 2. 20. 1 .

9.1'atius regnes3. In the following stanzas‘ Horace is thinking
of the Stoic paradox, that the wise man is king. Cp. Sat. 1. 3. 125,
136, Εὲρ. 1. 1. 107, &c., Sen. Thyest. 334 foll. ‘Regem non faciunt
o es c.

ΡΙο- 12. ‘Than if your property stretched into the far South and
West, so as to unite in one sway Carthage and its Spanish colonies.’
Gades was one of these. The expression should be compared with
Od. 3. 16. 31, 41 F ulgentem imperio fertilis Africae,' ‘Mygdoniis
zssffssgssnzsslyff2³..{33².¹{31⁵.h‘332¹}¹ss35¹2·f ...¹3⁰f12‘53530ffss‘ <222³¹322¹¹2033
1. 1. 9), which were one of the favourite means of investing and
acquiring wealth. Seneca expands this as other Horatian meta-

phors‚ Epp. 89‘ Hoc quoque parvum est nisi latifundiis vestris maria

cinxistis: nisi trans Hadriam et Ionium Aegaeumque vester vilicus

regnet. .sit fundus quod aliquando imperium vocabatur.’ In
both passages of Horace the metaphor of royalty is suggested by

the context—here by‘ latius regnes 'and the allusion to Phraates,
in 3.16 by‘ dominus splendidior’ and‘ vectigalia.'

11. et, ‘and so! Dinr. draws attention to the consecutive force
of‘ et,' as almost equal to‘ ita ut.’ Cp. 1. 3. 8, 4. ¹.3· 10.

13. indulgens sibi, ‘by indulging itselfss i. e. its own feverish '

ἴῂῖῗᾱτρρῆ( ‘the dropsy) It is properly the subject of‘ crescit,'
but it is n'iade also the subject of ‘indulgens' and ‘pellit‚' the
actions of the sick man being attributed to his malady.
