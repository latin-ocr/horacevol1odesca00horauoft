BOOK Ι, ODE III, 9-32

after Heinsius, would alter ‘siccis’ to ‘rectis’ (Cunningharn pro-
posed ‘fixis ’) with no MS. authority, on the ground that tears are
not with us the natural indication of terror. But Orelli quotes,
amongst other passages, Ov. Met. 11. 539, of a shipwreck, ‘ Non
tenet hic lacrimaS‚ stupet hic.’ When the panic falls on the Suitors
in Hom. Od. 20. 349, their eyes δακρυόφιν πίμπλαντο.

monstra. natantia, Od. 3. 27. 27 ‘scatentem beluis pontum,'
4. 14. 47 ‘ beluosus oceanus’; one of the stock dangers of the sea,
perhaps helped to become conventional in poetry by the popular
misunderstanding of Homer’s μεγακήτεα πόντον.

20. infamis, δυσωνύμους, with reference perhaps to their name,

, ‘the Thunder-cape.’ They were proverbial for storms and ship-

wrecks, Virg. G. 1. 332.

Acroceraunia. After Horace's manner he names a special
dangerous headland, as he has a special wind in v. 12, a special sea
in v. 15. They are all, however, actual dangers which Virgil
hliimseff must'encounter in passing from Brundisium to Dyrrha-
c ium.

22. prudens, ‘in his providence,’ Od. 3. 29. 29.

dissociabili, ‘ estranging’3 cp. the active use of ‘illacrymabilis ’
in Od. 2. 14. 6, though Horace himself uses it passively in Od. 4. 9.
263 so ‘penetrabilis,' Virg. G. 1. 933 ‘genitabilis,' Lucret. 1. 11.
Ritter and others deny this active use, and render it by ἅξενος; but

it is formed upon the verb ‘ dissociare ' and must mean either ‘able
. to sever,' as here, or ‘able to be severed,’ as in Claud. Ruf. 2. 238

‘ non dissociabile corpus.’

23. impiae, pred. ‘in their impiety.’

24., transiliunt, ‘leap lightly over.' The word is expressive, as
Ritter says, ‘ et levitatis et impudentiae.’ Cp. its use in Od. 1. 18. 7,
and Sil. Pun. 4. 71, of Hannibal, ‘ qui sacros montes rupesque pro-
fundas Transiluit.’

25. Ροτρθιίπιτλῆναι, uniting the ideas of ‘to bear' and ‘to dare.'
Compare the tone of Soph. Ant. 333 foll.

26. per vetitum nefas, ‘ through sin, despite of prohibition.’

27. Iapeti genus, Prometheus ; ‘genus ' as the Greek γένος.
Σισύφου γένος, for Ulysses‚ Eur. Cycl. 104; cp. Sat. 1. 6. 12

. ‘Laevinum Valeri genus.’

28. fraude mala, ‘an unhappy theft.’ There seems to be no

instance of ‘fraus ’ in a neutral sense, otherwise we might take it as
'2 a parallel of Cicero's ‘malus dolus,’ Off. 3. 15.

30. macies, ‘ wasting sickness,’ not to be distinguished from the

‘febres.' The things coupled are the effect of the severs and their

number.
31. incubuit, ἐπέσκηψεν, Lucret. 6. 1141 ‘morbifer aestus In-
cubuit populo Pandionis,’ ‘ fell upon,’ like a storm, or a bird of prey.
32. necessitas, with ‘leti,’ ‘the doom of death? Horace else-
where personifies ‘Necessitas’ (Od. 1. 35. 17, 3. 1. 14, 3. 24. 6),
but it is doubtful whether one person could be said ‘corripere
gradum’ of another.
