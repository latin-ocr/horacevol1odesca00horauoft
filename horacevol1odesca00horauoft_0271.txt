ODE XXXVI

‘ THANKS to the gods that have brought N umida safe home again,
, to· the delight of many friends, and of none more than his old
school-sellow Lamia. The day must have a white stone to mark it.

'‘1- We will revel, we will dance: Bassus shall rival Damalis in his
-; draughts of wine to·day. Every eye will be on Damalis; but·

;, Damalis will have no embraces sor any one but N umida.’

Nothing is known of Numida. Acr. and Porph. call him ‘ Pom-
ponius Numida,’ the Comm. Cruq. ‘ Plotius.’ The latter is more
likely to be right, as Numida is a known cognomen of the Plautia
or Plotia gens. It is usually supposed that he was returning from
the Cantabrian war, from which Augustus returned in Β. C. 24
(Otli. 3. 14). Numida may of course conceivably have returned
ear ier.

For Lamia, see on Od. 1. 26, 3. 17.

For the subject of the Ode cp. 2. 7 on the return of PompeiuS.

Metre — Third A sclepz'ad.

1. fidibus, of music at a sacrifice. Cp. Od. 4. 1. 21.

2. placare, a general word for ‘ to secure the favour’ of the gods,
without implying that they were angry before. Cp. Od. 3. 23. 3.

debito, cp. in the parallel Ode 2. 7. 17 ‘ obligatam redde Iovi
dapem‚' ‘ due,’ whether it had been actually vowed or not.

4. Hesperia, ‘ the West.' To the Greeks Italy was the ‘ western

η land,' and so we find the word used in Virgil. Horace himself uses

’ἶ it of Italy as compared with Parthia, Od. 2. 1. 32. In Roman
mouths generally it would mean the countries still further west, and

- be used of Spanish wars, &c.

Ι 8. non alio rege, see on Od. 4. 1. 4 ‘ sub regno Cinarae.’ The
’ expression seems partly to be due to the common mode of comput-
ing dates, ‘ consule Planco,' βασιλεύοντος Κύρου, &c., partly to

’.- contain a description of the imperious character of the rule‚ there of
4.· a mistress, here of a schoolmaster‚ like Horace's own ‘ plagosus

’1 orbilius:

puertiae. For the shortened form cp. ‘ lamna,’ Od. 2. 2. 2,
⁴ Epp.61. 15. 363 ‘surpuerat‚’ Od. 4. 13. 20 ; ‘ soldus,' S. 1. 2. 113,
2. 5. 5.

9. mutatae . . . togae, i. e. the assumption of the ‘toga virilis’
- instead of the ‘ praetexta' at the age of fifteen.

10. Cressa nota. Bentley seems to have been the first to suggest
that by ‘ Cressa nota’ Horace meant ‘a mark of Cretan stone‚’ i. e.
of chalk, called ‘ creta‚' or supposed to be called so, for the reason
sor which the Greeks called fuller’s earth Κιμωλία γῆ (Ar. Ran. 713,
Ov. Met. 7. 463 ‘Cretosaque rura Cimoli ⁹) from Cimolus, one of
the Cyclades, whence they obtained it. He pointed out that where
he is writing ‘ sermoni propiora‚' he calls it simply ‘ creta ’; S. 2. 3.
