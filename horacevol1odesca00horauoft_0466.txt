THE EPODES OF HORACE

9. ergo. ‘And so, ’-as he is free from these preoccupations, he
can enjoy the simple tasks and pleasures of the country.

propagine, the technical name for the young vine· plant grown
from a layer, Virg. G. 2. 26 and 63.

9-13. aut. . . aut . . que. Compare vv. 15, 16, 17 ‘’aut, ‘aut,’
‘vel.' The first triplet of alternatives describes the pleasant tasks
of preparation, the second those of gathering the fruits. In each
case the last of the three is marked by a change of the conjunctiora,
cp. vv. 31, 33, 35 ‘ aut‚’ ‘aut‚’ ‘que,’ Od. 1. 12. 5, 6 ‘aut,' ‘aut‚’ ‘ ve.’
Several editors have followed Fabricius in transposing vv. 11, 12
and 13, 14, on the ground that the pasturing of cattle seems out
of place between the more cognate operations of transplanting
vines and grafting fruit-trees. But it is scarcely possible that
the mistake should have vitiated every existing MS. Bentley points
out that the two operations are, after all, very distinct, and belong
to different times of the year. The feeling of the passage is the
great choice of pleasant tasks which the countryman enjoys, and
the sense of this would perhaps be diminished rather than increased
by sorting them too nicely.

10. altas answers to ‘ adulta’3 the plants are now (in three
years, Columella de Arb. 7) grown large enough to clamber a tree,
which would have been too tall for them before. Ritter points out
that ⁶ altas’ appeals to the eye, as does ‘ prospectat ’ in the next
couplet. His labour is associated with pleasant sights and sounds.
For the metaphor of ‘ maritat’ cp. Od. 2. 15. 4, 4. 5. 30.

13. que. It is better to take ‘ que' as disjunctive (see on Od. 1.
3. 9 and 3. 11. 49), than with Bentley to alter it here and in v. 63
to 11217.e ‘felici-orfea, abs Vj‘gss’ of the grafted tree, G. 2. 81 ‘ Exiit ad
cae um ramis e ici us.

16. infirmae. The Scholiast interprets ‘ unable to bear the
weight of their wool ’ς but it is probably no more than an habitual
epithet = ‘ molle pecus,' and only in point as helping the general
idea of peacefulness, ‘the unresisting sheep!

17. vel, see on v. 9-12. Macl. rightly points out that the uses
of ‘ vel cum,’ in an elliptical construction with no apodosis (as in
Virg. Aen. 11. 406), although quoted by Orelli and others, are not
relevant. Sat. 2. 7. 95 is a real parallel. The apodosis here is ‘ut
gaudet,' ‘ how he rejoices Ξ ’ cp. v. 61 ‘ ut iuvat.’

δ 19. gaudet decerpens, a Greek use of the participle, ἥδεται
ρεπων.

20. certantem purpurae, ⁴ rivalling the purple dye’ τ for dative
cp. Od. 1. Ι. 15 ‘luctantem fluctibus,' &c.

21. Priapus is to be paid as the protector of gardens. Virg. E.
7. 33, Catull. 20. Silvanus is not only, as in Od. 3. 29. 23, the wild
forest-god, but also a patron of country lise and pursuits‚ ‘ arvorum
pecorisque deus,’ Virg. Aen. 8. 601, and specially under the title of
‘Silvanus orientalis,' like Terminus, a protector of the sacred
‘ landmark,' the symbol of property, Dict. Biog. s, ν.
