THE ODES OF HORACE

12. auspiciis==‘ductu,’ and so ‘example'

14. eommune= τὸ κοινόν, here ‘the common stock,' ‘public
treasuryff

decempedis, ‘ten- foot rods,’ the common length apparently for
measuring rods; see mter al. Cic. Mil. 27. 74: ‘privatis’ i. e.
belonging to private persons. .

15. metata, passive, as in Sat. 2. 2. 114; see on Od. 1. 32. 5.

16. porticus, a colonnade facing north to avoid the sun and
catch the cool wind in summer. Contrast the winter dining-room
in Juv. 7. 183 ‘ algentem rapiat cenatio solem.’

17. fortuitum, τὸν ἐπιτυχόντα, ‘ the chance-cut turs ’ for building;
‘tuguri congestum caespite culmen‚’ Virg. E. 1. 69.

18-20. Public buildings and temples alike would be built ‘ publico
sumptu,’ and adorned ‘novo saxo'3 but in Horace’s manner the
qualifying words are divided between the two, see on 2. 10. 6,
2. 11. 1‚3. 4. 18,4. 9. 29, Epod. 5. 37.

20. novo saxo, from its position, seems intended as an antithesis
to ‘ fortuitum caespitem‚’ so that‘ novo' must be almost equivalent
to ‘exquisito,’ ‘hewn on purpose? Orelli compares, with the last
two stanzas, Cic. pro Flacc. 12. 28 ‘Haec ratio ac magnitudo
animorum in maioribus nostris fuit ut cum in privatis rebus suisque
sumptibus contenti tenuissimo cultu viverent in imperio atque in
publica dignitate omnia ad gloriam splendoremque revocarent?

ODE XVI

‘ REST is (at times at least) the prayer of all men, though they
do not go the way to find it. Gold and purple will not buy it,
Grosphus; neither wealth nor rank banish care; and meantime
very little suffices for a happy life if the heart is free from fear and
desire. Moderated desires, not hurrying from place to place, are
the means to avoid care. Go where you will you cannot escape
yourself. Care boards the bestappointed yacht and keeps up with
the fleetest horseman. Enjoy the present, and don’t think of the
future. If troubles come, smile and be patient and they will be
the lighter. Unmixed happiness is not to be looked for: Achilles

had glory, but with it an early death; Tithonus a long life and the ·,
weariness of old age. What you lack I may perhaps have, as you ’

have what Ι lack. You have flocks and herds and purple garments‚
{liliilicsssshave my little farm, my muse, and a heart to despise my

‘ Peacc and happiness depend on ours elves, not on things outside ’

of us? ‘Quod petis hic est Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit
aequus‚' Epp. 1. 11. 29.
