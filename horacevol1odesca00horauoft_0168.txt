GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO THE EPODES

All the indications of date to be discovered in the poems them· ,³
selves fix them to the first period of his life as an author. Their ἶ,
references to current politics, both positively‚ as in the allusions to j
the war with Sextus Pompeius, and negatively‚ in the vagueness ¹.
with which they deal with the general situation at home (see on .=
Epod. 7 and 16), belong to the decade between the battles of Philippi
and Actium. We notice in their style indications which point the j
same way—occasional harshnesses of construction, a redundancy ξ
of epithets, a tendency even in the best poems to poetica! common· Ξ
place, we may add a grossness of subject and language, which his ζ
mature taste would have pruned away. The Epodes stand with
the Satires at the opening of Horace’s literary life—not unconnected ·
with them in tone, nor in their literary antecedents‚ nor in their ῗ
treatment in his hands. The Roman Satirist, he tells us, looked,
for all but the poetical form of his composition, to Greek Comedy. ξ
In the Epode he has returned to the personal lampoon‚ the earliest ’
use of poetry for purposes of attack and caricature, and that of s
which Comedy, according to Aristotle (Poet. l. c.)‚ was the develop'· ²
ment. It is in the taste which leads him for models to Lucilius'and -
Archilochus, rather than in any bitterness of special poems, that we '
may trace probably his own description already referred to (Epp. 2.

2. 51; see Introd. to Books i- iii, ᾗ 1) of the personal motives that
'first drove him to write poetry. In any case it is characteristic of}
the man that his Satires should mellow and humanize into the
Epistles, and that the Epodes should drop so early their ιάμβικὴ ’
ἰδέα, and sosten and generalize into the Odes. The process in both ¹
cases is nearly complete before the name of the composition is
changed.

Horace speaks himself (Epod. 14) of the Book as preparing 'for
publication, and as having occupied some space of time in eom-
position. The date of its publication is generally held to be fixed

by the relation between Epod. 9 and Od. 1. 37, to the year Β. c. 31-30.
