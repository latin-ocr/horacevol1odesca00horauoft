THE ODES OF 'HORACE

The link between the praises of Tibur and the story of Te icet
is to be found in vv. 109—31. Plancus has had to leave his home

ξ

ὶ

at Tibur and go campaigning. ‘ I feel with you‚’ says the poet, ‘to ς
the utmost: but you will come home again. In any case drink

and forget care. It is the sort of trouble that heroes have to ᾗ

face.’

The Scholiasts identisy Plancus with the L. Munatius Plancus ᾖ
who was consul in B.C. 42 (Od. 3. 14. 28 ‘consule Planco '). He 3

was a politician who had changed sides several times in the civil

war. Many stories to his discredit are told by Velleius Paterculus, ,¹
who calls him ‘ morbo proditor.’ He had reconciled himself to ᾗ
Octavianus, and it was on his proposal that the title of Augustus ³
was conferred upon him in B.C. 27. If this is so, the place of the ⁷

Ode has the same significance as that of 4 and 6.

With the story of Teucer at the end of the Ode compare the con·

clusion of Epod. 13. 11 ad fin.

ἲ.

Several of the best MSS. begin a new Ode at v. 15. The division ..
was as old as Porph., for he notices and condemns it; on v. 15
‘ Hanc Oden quidam putant aliam esse, sed eadem est 3 nam et hic

ad Plancum loquitur cuius in honorem et in superiore parte Tibur ἓ

4Β

laudavit, Plancus enim inde fuit oriundus.’ Mistakes in the matter ·
are common in the MSS. See Epod. 2. 23 and 9. 27. Porph. γ
mentions and condemns a division of Od. 3. 24 at v. 25, though it is ·

not so found in any extant MS. The opposite mistake occurs in
Od. 2. 14, 15, which are written continuously in several of the oldest
MSS„ although there is no conceivable connexion between them.

6. perpetuo, a continuous poem, not merely touching incidentally
on Athens, Ov. Met. 1. 4 ‘ prima ab origine mundi In mea perpetuum
deducite tempora carmen?

7. ‘ To wreathe their brow with the olive plucked on every hand,’

i. e. to seek fame by writing on a well—worn theme. This is Bentley’s .

interpretation. The expression contains a reminiscence of Lucret.

1. 926 ‘iuvat . . . novos decerpere flores, Insignemque meo capiti ·

petere inde coronam Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae,’

a passage which Horace imitates again in Od. 1. 26. 6, 7. The ⁴²

‘olive’ leaf is specially named as the appropriate crown for one
who wrote of Athens: Bentley quotes Sen. Herc. F. 913 ‘Populea
nostras arbor exornet comas, Te ramus oleae fronde gentili tegat,
