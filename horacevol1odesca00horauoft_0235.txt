moenia Catili, a further description of ‘Tiburis solum ’-; for
' Catilus see on Od. 1. 7. 13, and cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 672. Horace

Compare his use of ‘ Porsena‚' Epod. 16. 4.
3. siccis, the opp. of ‘ uvidis,' Od. 4. 5. 39 ‘ dicimus integro Sicci
mane die, dicimus uvidi, Cum sol Oceano subest '; cp. Epp. 1. 19. 9.
dura, tertiary pred. ‘All that heaven ever sets before them, every
2. task and fortune, is hard.’
Ἰ deus, as in Od. 1. 3. 21 3 not Bacchus, but the Power which
rules our life.
4. aliter, ‘in any other way than this,’ the true way is implied by
‘ siccis ' in the opposed clause.
5. erepat, like the Gr. παταγεῖν, κροτεῖν, of rattling or tiresome
„ talk, S. 2. 3. 32 ‘si quid Stertinius veri crepat'3 Epp. 1. 7. 84
, ‘sulcos et vineta crepat mera'; A. P. 247 ‘immunda crepent
. ignominiosaque dicta.' So that it can only be used with the next
⁴ verse by a zeugma.

ι. 7. ao ne, the reading of the great majority of the MSS.; and
„ Bentley shows that it, and not ‘at ne‚’ is the common formula of
transition even when, as here and in Epp. 2. 1. 208, we seem to
ἒ require an adversative.
modici, ‘that loves moderation‚' ‘ verecundum Bacchum,’ Od. 1.
ἒ 27. 3. It would properly be the epithet of the draught, ὃς δ’ ἂν
»ὥ ὑπερβάλλῃ πόσιος μέτρον, Theogn. 47, or of the proportions of the
4 mixture, see on Od. 1. 20. 1.
ᾗ transiliat, see on 1. 3. 24, ‘lightly to overpass the bounty of
3 Liber,’ δῶρα Διονύσου, is not to be content with what the god allows
Ξ us, but to take more ‘invito deo‚’ v. 12.

,ἦ super mero. ‘’Super possibly of place,‘ over the wine? It
.' has also been taken (so perhaps the Schol. who interprets‘ propter
. vinum ') as === ‘.’cle Cp. super· urbe curas' Od. 3 8.17. If so,
q llilorace' is forgetting the legend in which wine was not the cause of
t e quarrel.
9. debellata, see on Od. 1. 3. 13.
Sithoniis, properly the inhabitants of the middle finger of the
⁷¹ three which run out into the Aegean from Chalcidice. For Thracian

Δ 9,10. ‘There is warning in the heavy hand of Evius on the
Sithonians, when ιιι their greedy haste they divide right and wrong
by the slender line of their own appetite,’ i. e. when the only dis-
’Ἲ ῐίιιιεῐίοιι they place between right and wrong is that they desire the
t ln or not.
