CARMEN SAECULARE, 47-68

47. Romulae3 see Od. 4. 5. 1, and on 1. 15. 10. For the elision
of ‘ que' at the end of the line cp. Od. 4. 2. 22, 23.

49. quae veneratur. ‘Veneror ' is used of prayer, as in Sat. 2.
2. 124, Virg. Aen. 3. 4603 here, as in Sat. 2. 6. 8 ‘ si veneror stultus
nihil horum,’ with an accusative of the thing prayed for.

bobus* albis. The modal ablative would suit ‘veneror’ in its
usual sense of ‘to do homage to’ (cp. e. g. Virg. Aen. 5. 745),
better than in its sense, as here, of ‘to pray.’ As has been noticed‚
the mention of ‘boves ’ as forming the sacrifice indicates that the
chorus is addressing Jupiter and Juno.

50. sanguim Od. 2. 20. 6, 3. 27. 65, 4. 2. 14.

51. bellante prior. This is part of the prayer, a picture of what
Augustus desires to be, the picture drawn by Anchises in Virg. Aen.
6. 853 ‘Parcere subiectis et debellare superbos?

54. Medus. This is after the restoration of the standards in
13..;czo cp...Od45.6,.4..‚.1442Epp118..56

Albanae securie, the fasces, the emblem of Roman rule.
‘Alban ’ because of the connexion of the origin of Rome with Alba.
It is not quite the same as Virgil’s ‘ Albanique patreS, ‘ Aen. 1 73
see Conington in loc..

55. responsa. This would be the usual word for any reply given
to an embassy sent with a request or reference, as in Liv. 9. 38

‘sine responso legatos dimisit? Standing here alone, without
mention of the ‘legati,’ it is meant probably to. draw a more
poetical colour from its use of the answers of gods, oracles, &c.;
cp. Virg. E. 1. 44 ‘ Hic mihi responsum primus dedit ille petenti.'
F or the fact see on Od. 2.‘9. 23, 3. 29. 28, 4. 14. 42.

’ 6ο. cornu3 see on Od. 1. 17. 16.

65. si, with the indicative apodosis (see on v. 68), must=‘ if, as
doubtless he does!

aren. This was the reading of V, and was found by Porph„ who
interprets‘ si acceptas aras habet quae in Palatio dedicatae sunt)
. B supports the vulg! arces?

66. felix, better taken with‘ Latium’ than with‘ lustrum) It is
not Rome and Latium that Apollo will prolong, but‘ the state and
power of Rome and the happiness os Latium. ’ It is still very likely
that Horace remembered the conjunction of the words in Ennius’
verses, ‘Audire est operae pretium, procedere recte Qui rern
Romanam Latiumque augescere vultis’ 3but even there‘ Latium-
que’ is in its own clause, and not a bald addition to ‘rem
Romanam.

67. lustrum3 Od. 2. 4. 23. The period is named here clearly
as the time for which nominally Augustus has reaccepted the
‘Imperium’3 see Introd.

meliusque, ‘ and for ages that grow ever better!

68. prorogat This, and the corresponding ‘curat‚’ ‘applicat,’
are the readings of B and V, against the more common ‘ proroget, ⁹

‘,'curet ‘applicet’ It would seem that the Scholiasts read the
subjunctive in the first case, but the indicative in the other two;
