THE ODES OF HORACE

nected with the personal occasion or with the gnomic introduction3
and it is evidently parallel to the ‘ gigantomachia ’ of Ode 4 and to
the Regulus-story of Ode 5, both of which have a bearing on the
subject which none can mistake. What the purpose is in this case
cannot be explained as certainly.

Many editors have recalled the story preserved by Suetonius
(Jul. 79) that among the causes of the Dictatofs unpopularitywas

a rumour ‘ migraturum Alexandriam vel Ilium translatis simul ·

opibus imperii, exhaustaque Italia delectibus‚ et procuratione
urbium amicis permissa! Mommsen lends the weight of his
authority to the view that Horace is referring, not indeed to any
such specific rumour, but to a feeling, already in the air ¹, that the
extension and consolidation of the empire would lead, as it actually
led in the end, to the transference of the centre of gravity to the
eastern end of the Mediterranean. He is expressing the mind of
Augustus in reassuring Roman patriots on this point: the revival
and glorification of Rome, not its displacement, is the idea of the
empire. It will be seen that apart from this Ode the evidence is
very slight that any such political idea was practically before men's
minds ε and when we read the Ode itself the theory fails to account
for all the facts. It does not explain the emphasis laid throughout
on the moral characteristics of Troy, nor ⁴give the connexion which
there should be between the story and the earlier part of the Ode.

It had been already pointed out that one key to the episode is
found in the fact mentioned by Dion (53. 16), Suetonius (Oct. 7),
and Florus (2. 34), that when Octavianus took the title of Augustus
it had been in contemplation (according to some accounts it had
been his own desire) that he should be called Romulus, as the
second Founder of the Roman state. This must certainly be in
Horace's mind. It explains why Romulus is (v. 15) the climax of
the instances of immortality won by labours in the cause of civiliza-
tion: ‘Yes,' he says, ‘ Augustus is a second Romulus; only the
second Founder will remember the lesson set to the first F ounder
—Rome was to be Rome, not a second Troy.²

Pliiss and those who follow him see in this warning an allegorical
picture of the danger of returning, ‘nimium pii,’ to the political
ideals of the Republic. It may be doubted whether Horace or his
master would have wished to draw such a sharp line as this implies
between the constitution before and after the beginning of the princi-
pate. Augustus is set forth in these Odes as the restorer of the old
rather than as the founder of 'a new order of things. But probably
the dangers of which the poet speaks are not, primarily‚ political. It
’ must be remembered that the words are put into Juno’s mouth not
in the middle, but at the commencement of Roman history. They
are the imagined charter of its greatness—recalled now, doubtless

¹ He sees a confirmation of this in the curious story, upon which, writing
about the same time, Livy dwells (5. 24), that it was proposed in the time
of Camillus to remove the seat of government to Veii.
