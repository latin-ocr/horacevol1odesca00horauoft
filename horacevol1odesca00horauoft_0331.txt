BOOK 111, ODE 1, 9-43

29—32. Cp. Epp. 1. 8. 4 foll. ‘Haud quia grando Contuderit vitis
oleamque momorderit aestuS‚' &c. The farm has broken its promise
of yield (cp. Epp. 1. 7. 87 ‘spem mentita seges,’ and contrast Od.
3. 16. 30 ‘segetis certa fides ’), and the fruit-trees are represented
as always able (‘ nunc,' ‘nunc,’ ⁴ nunc') to excuse themselves, and
throw the blame on the weather.

32. sidera, the heat attributed to the Dogstar. Epod. 16. 61
‘ nullius astri Gregem aestuosa torret impotentia.’

33. eontracta. pisces, &c. Variously taken of the ‘piscinae

marinae’ in which the fish find themselves enclosed, and of the
sea at large, which is represented as narrowed by the number of
villas built into it. The latter is more probable, and the hyperbole
is not greater than 3. 24. 1.
· 34. iactis molibus; cp. the description of the process in Virg.
Aen. 9. 710 foll. ‘Talis in Euboico Baiarum litore quondam
Saxea pila cadit, magnis quam molibus ante Constructam ponto
iaciunt ⁹ &c.

huc: into the space enclosed by the masses of masonry that have
been let down into the water.

35. caementa are the rough stones and rubble used for filling
the cavities of walls in the foundations of buildings. Horace

himself, as a'll engaged in hurrying on the work.

36. terrae fastidiosus, like ‘parum locuples continente ripa,’
2. 18. 22, except that here it is the sense of weariness, there of
greed‚ that is prominent.

37. Minae, the forebodings of his own imagination.

38. scandunt, they can clamber into the villa built out in the
water, by the same entrance as the master.

neque decedit, &c., the marine villa is lost in the general idea
of the impossibility of flying from care. With the whole stanza
cp. 2. 16. 21 foll. and see note there. The reminiscence of Lucretius
(2. 47 foll.) is more evident in this place than in that. ‘Timor et
Minae’ recalls ‘metus hominum, curaeque sequaces,’ and in the
following stanza we may hear the echo of ‘neque fulgorem reve·
rentur ab auro, N ec clarum vestis splendorem purpureai.’

41. quodsi, &c. The application of the moral professedly to
himself, really to those whose desires are not as moderate.

dolentem, in body or mind. Cp. Epp. 1. 2. 46 foll. ‘ Quod satis
est cui contingit nihil amplius optet. ‘Non domus et fundus, non
aeris acervus et auri Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febris, Non
animo curas.’

Phrygius lapis, a famous marble, white with red spots, brought
from Synnada in Phrygia. Cp. esp. Stat. Silv. 1. 5. 37.

43. usus, like other expressions of the Ode, seems to be due to
Virg. G. 2. 466 ‘ N ec casialiquidi corrumpitur usus olivi.' Conington
(in loc.) points out that the two constructions are not exactly
parallel. The ‘wearing of purple' is the subject of ‘delenit’ in
