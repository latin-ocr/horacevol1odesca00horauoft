a vestal, the singular number probably having reference to the
‘Virgo Maxima.’ The special ceremony referred to is thought
to be one which took place on the Ides of March, when prayers
were offered in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus for the salubrity
of the coming year, and other rites were performed under the
superintendence of the Pontifex Maximus and the Virgo Maxima,
or chief of the Vestals.

10 foll. It is a question whether ‘qua violens,’ &c.‚ qualifies
‘ dicar ’ (‘ many shall say of me on the banks of my native Aufidus,
that I was the first,' &c.) or ‘princeps deduxisse’ (‘1 shall be
spoken of as one who by the banks of Aufidus was the first,'
&c.). The last is the more likely. Horace wishes his birthplace
to‘ be remembered in his own fame, ‘longe sonantem natus ad
Aufidum,’ 4. 14. 2 3 but he is claiming world-wide fame, not merely
to be remembered in his birthplace. There is a further question
as to the construction of ‘ex humili potens! Most editors have
taken it of Horace himself, ‘raised from humility to glory‚’ com-
paring Epp. 1. 20. 20 ‘ Me.libertino natum patre et in tenui re
Maiores pennas nido extendisse.’ Bentley prefers to refer the
words to Daunus, as describing his rise. The story made him
an Illyrian exile, who became King of Apulia. If it be taken so,
Horace must still be thinking of himself, and seeing a likeness
of his own fortunes in those of Daunus.

10. violens obstrepit, ‘ longe sonans,’ ‘ acer,’ Sat. 1. 1. 58. Cp.
Od. 4. 14. 25. The Aufidus is within ten miles of Venusia, and
Horace must have seen it in flood. ‘Like most of the rivers of
Italy, it has much of the character of a mountain torrent,’ Dict.
Geog. For the absol. use of ‘ obstrepit ' cp. Epod. 2. 27.

11. pauper aquae3 Epod. 3. 16 ‘siticulosae Apuliae.'

12. regnavit populorum, a Greek gen. ἦρξε λαῶν.

13. Aeolium carmen, &c., ‘to have made the lyric poetry of
Aeolia at home among Italian measures.' The use of ‘ deducere’
seems akin to that of ‘ deducere coloniam!

14. superbiam. The Muse who inspires is so identified with
the poet that his pride and his merits are hers, though it is she that
crowns him. Kiessling makes ‘superbiam ' abstr. for coner„ the
proud decoration, but this is unnecessary. For the use of ‘ sume '
cp. Caes, B. G. 1. 33 ‘tantos sibi spiritus tantam arrogantiam
sum serat.'

153De1ph10a = ‘ Apollinari,’ Od. 4. 2. 9.

16. volene, ‘of thy grace,’ θέλουσα, ἑκοῦσαι it is common in
prayer, but gen. with the addition ‘ propitiusque,’ Liv. 7. 26. 4.
