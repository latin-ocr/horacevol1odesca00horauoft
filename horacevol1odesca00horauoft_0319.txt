BOOK ΙΙ, ODE XVII, 17—ODE XVIII

29. Mercurialium. ‘Mercuriales' was the name of a ‘geolle ium
mercatorum’ at Rome, which was associated with the‘ cultugs’ of
Mercurius, the god of traffic, Cic. ad Quint Fr. 2. 5, Liv. 2. 21, 27.
the word was thus familiar to people' 5 ears as meaning ‘favourites
of Mercury? Horace applies it in Sat. 2. 3. 25 to Damasippus, the

connoisseur who could buy everything so as to make a profit, from

old bronzes to estates; and here (Mercury being identified with
the Greek Hermes) to himself, as under the special protection of
the god who was ‘curvae lyrae parens,' Od. 1. 10. 6, 3-11. 1, Epod.
13. 9, See. Cp also Od. 2. 7. 13.

ODE XVIII

‘I HAVE no ivory couches nor gilded ceiling nor rare marbles
nor palace nor crowd of retainers. Yet I have honour and wit and
the respect of those richer than myself‚ and I am contented. You
lay house to house as if you were to live for ever. The land is not

ξ large enough, you must build m the sea. Nay, you must pluck up
. your neighbour's landmark and drive out your own client to
- misery. Yet more surely than any house that you are building
the grave awaits you. Think of that limit--the grave, where you

and your poor neighbours, oppressor and oppressed, are on an .

ψ equality.²

. Horace opposes two pictures· one, of himself, contented and

happy with his farm and his poetry; the other, of, some rich man
so full of plans for building and increasing his property as to forget
death and to commit wrong and robbery. Ode 15 complained
of the great growth of the villas of the wealthy on the ground of
the waste of land which was wanted for agriculture. This Ode
touches on another evil incidental to this passion, the unjust and
cruel eJection of small owners from their ancestral properties. It ι5
this which gives the special colour to the usual satire on the solly

Χ . of leaving death out of our calculations. Death· 1s not only more
gefersvaiginglgan all our plans, he 1s the great equahzer and redresser

With the picture of the grasping proprietor compare Sallust’ s
, expressions where he 1s tracing that alienation of classes which led
to the civil wars, Jug. 41 ‘populus militia atque inopia urgebatur;
praedas bellicas imperatores cum paucis diripiebant; interea
parentes aut parvi liberi militum ut quisque potentiori confinis erat

. sedibus pellebantur?
The early part of the Ode is not unlike m expression a fragment
(28) of Bacchylides. —

³ οὗ βοῶν πάρεστι σώματ’, οὔτε χρυσός, οὔτε πορφύρεοι τάπητες, ἀλλὰ
θυμὸς εὐμενὴς·
Μοῦσά τε ’γλυκεῖά καὶ Βοιωτίοισιν ἐν σκύφοισιν οινος ἡδύς.
