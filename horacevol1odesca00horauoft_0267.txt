BOOK Ι, ODE XXXV, 1—17

8. carpathium, the sea between Rhodes and Crete, named
from the island Carpathus. Like ‘Bithyna’ it is merely a special
name for a general. There is a point, however, in naming as many
countries as may be.

9. asper, the Dacian who stands fiercely at bay (cp. ‘tigris
aspera‚’ Od. 1. 23. 9) is contrasted with the nomad Scythians who,
if attacked, retreat into their boundless steppes. These again,
perhaps with more settled peoples, ‘urbesque.’ The object of all

’ the epithets is to insist on the universality of Fortune's sway

(cp. 1. 34. 9—11, 3. 4. 45—48). No distance or difference of life

> exempts men from it. This is brought out equally by the anti-

thetical form of v. 9 and by the quick accumulation of copulatives
m vv. 10-12.

10. ferox, exactly corresponds to Goldsmith’s ‘pride in their
port, defiance in their eye.' Cp. 3. 3. 44.

11, 12. The mothers of eastern princes fear for their sons, as
Atossa for Xerxes (cp. Od. 3. 2. 7), and princes in the midst of
their splendid state sear for themselves.

14. columnam. The pillar seems to be metaphorlcal, an
emblem of stability, as we might say colloquially, ‘pull the house
about our ears! The best illustration‚ perhaps the source, is a line
of Ennius (Annales 3 51, Vahlen), which Donatus quoted in explain-
ing ‘ columen familiae? Ter. Phorm. 2. 1. 58, ‘Regni versatum
[pilam ?] summamve columnam.' Some editors have thought of
the column erected in the Forum by the people in memory of

. Julius Caesar, and destroyed again by Dolabella, Suet. Jul. 85, Cic.

Phil. 1. 2.

frequens, ‘ crowding‚’ ‘ gathering in crowds.’

15. ‘Arouse to arms the loiterers, to arms ’ς ‘ad arma’ is the
actual cry. Ovid imitates the repetition, Met. 11. 377 ‘Cuncti
coeamus et arma, Arma capessamus '; 12. 241 ‘ Certatimque omnes
uno ore arma, arma loquuntur.’

17. serva, ‘stern,' cp. Od. 1. 28. 20. The balance of MS.

’ authority is in favour of the reading ‘ serva,’ which Porph. interprets

as= ‘ slavish,' i.e. bringing slavery with it. Acr., though offering this
as an alternative, takes it in what, if we retain it, is doubtless its
true sense, as her slave, ‘ quasi sit Necessitas comes et ministra F or-
tunae.’ Keller, believing ‘ saeva ' to be the original reading, thinks
that this explanation of Acr. is what led to the corruption, having
been meant to explain not ‘ serva,' but ‘ anteit,' and that Acron him-
self found ‘ saeva! Those who reject ‘ serva ’ urge that ‘Necessitas'
seems to want an epithet as in the corresponding passage (q.v.)‚
Od. 3. 24. 6 ‘ Si figit adamantinos Summis verticibus dira Necessitas
Clavos.’ The hails, &c. belong to Necessitas: they are not carried
by her for Fortuna. We do not wish, even if it were possible, to
make too perfect an image of the procession. The details of one
