Bacchantes by the possession of the god and the power to sing
‘ 1ξύΙ parvum nil mortale,’ which the same inspiration gives to

‘ ornatus viridi tempora pampino Liber.'

ODE XXVI

THE poet professes himself foiled in his addresses to Chloe, and
recognizes the meaning of the failure: ‘ He has made his conquests
in his time3 but his campaigns are over. Here in Venus' temple
he will hang up the instruments of gallantry for which he has
no more use. May Venus (we expect, ‘grant him peace at last,’

‘ ῐεῙιοὶετεΙΙιίῙῐξι, further love troubles ’) make Chloe feel one little smart

that it is only just over.

3. The arms of the warfare which he abandons (cp. 4. 1. 16
‘militiae tuae ⁹) are to be suspended in the temple of VenuS‚ as
the ‘gladiator emeritus,’ Epp. 1. 1. 4, affixes his arms ‘ Herculis ad

ostem.’
p 4. barbiton. The lute implies that his love-songs are over as
well as his loves.

The meaning of the particularity is not clear. Possibly Horace is
referring to a special temple. Possibly it is the side of good omen,
and indicates that the warfare is viewed as ‘bone ac feliciter
eractum.’
