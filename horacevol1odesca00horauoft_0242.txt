THE ODES OF 'HORACE

10. 3- 5‘ cetera paene gemelli Fraternis animis-quidquid negat alter ·
et alter-Adnuimus pariter vetuli notique columbi? He appears in
S 1. 10. 83 amongst the critics by whose judgement Horace will
abide, in S. 1. 9 as the friend who wickedly escapeS, leaving the
poet ‘sub cultro! He is called by Acr. on Epp. 1. 10 ‘scriptor ’
tragoediarum? by Porph. ‘comoediarumss by both, on S. 1. 9, ς
‘grammaticorum doctissimus? but nothing' 15 known of him from -

other sources.

1. integer vitae. S. 2. 3. 220 ‘integer animi.’

sceleris purus, Od. 3. 17. 16 ‘operum solutis! Two uses of the ν
Greek genitive, for each of which the Latin idiom would have the ⁷
ablative. Cp. S. 2. 3. 213 ‘purum est vitio tibi. . . cor,’ Madv. .-
ξ 290 g, ξ 268 b, obs. 2.

5. aestuosas. As far as concerns Horace’s use of words there is ji

of the boiling surf of the bay, ‘Barbaras Syrtis ubi Maura semper Ϊ·
Aestuat unda,' Od. 2. 6. 3. Perhaps the similarity of that place j.
makes for the latter interpretation, as in that case both passages
will combine the same two dangers. You have to choose between
a furious sea, if you don’ t land, and savage inhabitants if you do,
The proverbial danger of the Syrtes consisted partly 1n the number ,
of sunken rocks in the bay, partly 111 deep quicksands which lined
the shore. ,

6. inhospitalem Caucasum, Epod. 1. 10; Aesch. P. V. 20, of
the Same mountains, τῷδ’ ἀπανθρώπῳ πάγῳ. ’

7. fabulosus, with its storied dangers, the stories that would be
told of India as of any unknown southern country, of its jungles, its
strange beasts. The Hydaspes is a river of the Punjaub, the
modern Jelum, Virg. G. 4. 211. ·

8. lambit, used of the gentle wash of water, as of fire, S. 1. 5. 73,
Virg. Aen. 2. 683, ἃς.

9. namque. The whole force of the Ode is thrown on Horace's
miraculous escape, which is the sufficient justification both of the ·
general statement in the two preceding stanzas of the safety of =
innocence‚ and of the particular statement in the two that follow of ··
the poet’ 5 own indifference to outward circumstances, see Introd. »Γ
to 1. 34.

10. ultra terminum, beyond the bounds of his own farm. A few ·
acres of the forest belonged to him, Od. 3. 16. 29, S. 2. 6. 3.

11. expeditiS, as Catull. 31. 7 ‘O quid solutis est beatius curis. θ’ - ¹
a variation of the more usual‘ expedire, solvere animum curis.'1t -
is the reading of the best MSS„ and Porph. explains it, ‘curis
expeditis pro ipse curis expedituS.’ Bentley defends th'e less·
supported reading ‘expeditus.' Dillr. points out that the ὁμοιο- 4
τέλευτ τ,ον —is -is, is in Sapphic verses rather an argument for the ᾗ
reading. There are six other instances in the Ode, vv. 3, 9,14,17, 3
18, 22.
