BOOK I, ODE Ι, 29—ODE II, 12

moment. The Ode is fitly placed in the forefront of the three Books,
as containing once for all Horace’s palinode and ‘ apologia) He is
professing and explaining his conversion to Caesarism. He has
thought over the signs of divine wrath which followed Caesar's
. death, and learnt that the act of Brutus was a crime. The space os
time during which he was learning the lesson is lost to sight. The
- political point of view is an advance on Epodes 7 and 16. The
¹ ‘scelus' of Epod. 7 is summed up in one act of profitless and
sacrilegious bloodshed. A remedy for the evils of the state has
been seen more practical than that proposed in Epod. 16. But the

ἶ grounds alleged are still substantially the same, weariness of the
ς’ civil war with its horrors at horne and impotence abroad. There is
i no sorecast as in Book iii of the special results social and moral to

be looked for from the new regime3 but in the choice of ‘the gentle

Maia’s son, ' the god of peaceful artS‚ of persuasion and of commerce,

as the deity whom he sees incarnat'e in the‘ avenger,' he indicates

’ the nature yof the rule he looks to.

Virg. Georg. 1. 466 to the end, should be compared with the Ode
as affording a parallel both in sentiment and in many points in

v <3pr eSSlon.

⁴ Dillenburger points out that though put only with the last of the

J two subst. after Horace's manner, it qualifies both. He gives the
’ἶ following list of instances, Od. 1. 31. 16, 1. 34. 8, 2. 8. 3, 2. 19. 24,
