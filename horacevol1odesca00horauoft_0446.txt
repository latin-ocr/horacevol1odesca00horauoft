THE ODES OF HORACE

Augustus ‘iuvenis’ in 1 2 41. There is, perhaps, a small indica-

parallel expressions ‘Ut tamen noris quibus advoceris Gaudiisss
11.13 ‘Ad quae si properas gaudiass 12. 21. The Scholiasts and

inscriptions of MSS. call Vergilius‘ unguentarius} ⁴,mercator' ’
‘negotiator,' ‘medicus Neronum) All look as if they were infer· ,

ences more or less clumsy from words of the Ode itse1f3 but the

general impression, in spite of the temptation to identify him with ι

the only well-known Vergilius, that he was a different and later
person, is of some value.

The substance of the Ode is very parallel to one of Catullus (13),
in which he bids Fabullus come to supper, and bring with him all
the materials save the unguent, which he will supply himself, and
which he promises shall be so delicious that Fabullus will wish
that he were all nose.

1. veris comites, the north winds, as appears from the epithet
‘Thraciae,’ the designation of the Greek poets for the wind, which
to them really blew from Thrace 3 ἀπὸ Στρυμόνος, Aesch. Agam. 192.
Columella (1 1. 2. 21) speaks of the north winds as blowing generally
for a month from Feb. 20, and as bearing the name of ‘ Ornithiae,'
‘ tum et hirundo venit.’ Cp. v. 5.

temperant, ‘ calm ' the sea, after its winter disturbance.

6. infelix avis.1t is difficult to say whether the swallow
(Epp. 1. 7. 13 ‘Cum Zephyris. .et hirundine prima ') or the nightin-
gale (ἦρος ἅγγελος ἶμερόφωνος ἀηδών, Sapph. Fr. 42) is meant. The
legend is told in various ways, some poets making Procne the
mother of Itys, and some Philomela; see Conington, Virg. E. 6. 78.
As Ovid tells it at length (Met. 6. 424 foll.,) Procne was the
daughter of Pandion, king gtof Athens (‘ Cecropiae domus‚’ v. 6), and
married to Tereus, a Thracian prince. To avenge her sister Philo-
mela, whom he had outraged, she served up to her husband the
flesh of their child Itys, and when he would have taken vengeance
on her, the sisters were changed, one into a swallow, the other into
a nightingale, Tereus himself into a hoopoe.

7. male, with ‘ ulta, ’ ‘cruelly, ’ ‘ unnaturallyss

barbarae regum. The plural generalizes—an act of lust such as
barbarian princes used to commit; the poetical transference of the
epithet from‘ regum' to ‘libidinesss does not separate it from the
princles, lbut οοηηῧξῒε it {nore clpfiely wfitg tlsseir acts. They were
