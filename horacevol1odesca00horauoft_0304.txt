THE ODES OF HORACE

to strengthen ‘ mutuis’ 3 and also because the main topic is praise
of Licymnia, not of Maecenas. -

17-20. See Introd. nee dedecuit suggests rather the idea of
condescension.

19. nitidis, in holiday dress.

satiro Dianae celebris die, ‘ the sacred day that fills Diana’s
tem e.'

21Ρί Achaemenes, the mythical founder of the Achaemenid v
family, and so standing for a Persian king ; 3. 9. 4 ‘ Persarum vigui

rege beatior.’ Horace uses the adjective ‘Achaemenius' for j,-

‘ Persian‚' Od. 3. 1. 44, Epod. 13. 8.
22. Mygdoniae, ‘ Mygdon's wealth in fat Phrygia? Cp. Od. 3.
16. 41. Mygdon is a prince of the Phrygians in Hom. 11. 3. 186.

26. facili, that yields easily—an oxymoron.
27. poscente magis, ‘ more than you who ask for them?

27, 28. gaudeat, occupet, are subjunctive because they give the ’-

reason for the epithet ‘ facili saevitia? Bentley would read ‘ occupat ’

ODE XIII

THE thoughts suggested by the fall of a tree on his Sabine farm
from which Horace narrowly escaped. For other allusions to the .

incident see Od. 2. 17. 27, 3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8; and on the date of all 7

the Odes which refer to it see Introd. to Books i—iii, § 8.

The poem begins with a burst of indignation, at least half '
humorous (comp. Epod. 3), at the unlucky tree and the wretch that

planted it. Then, from the mention (v. 12) of the accident that had · ’
so nearly overwhelmed him, rises the thought, ‘ How little we guess ⁷ ’
the quarter from which danger really threatens us. We fix our ⁴

eyes on some one risk and fear that only, but death comes to all the

world from the quarter they do not expect? Next, suggested by; -

the ‘leti vis rapuit rapietque,' comes the remembrance how very ’
near to death he has been, ‘ how near seeing Proserpine and Aeacus

on his seat of judgement and the separate abode of happy souIS‚· ·
among them ' (here comes the last change) ‘ those whom the· lyric 7·
poet would first look for, Sappho and Alcaeus. An admiring throng 7

of shades is round both, but the larger and the more attentive round
Alcaeus. What wonder if they listen, when even Cerberus is spell- ⁴ ¹
bound, and Prometheus and Tantalus forget their pains, and Orion ν ·
stays from his hunting to hear? “
