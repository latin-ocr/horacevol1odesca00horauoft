GENERAL INTRODUCTION

again we lack a solid ground on which to rest the division. For

³* few MSS. exhibit such a type consistently. They pass from one

- class to another in successive pages. The grouping in pairs, which

from being so that the two modes of relating MSS. are at times at
variance. A and a, for instance, which are supposed to be derived
in large part from-a single archetype, are ranked often for pages
together in different classes. One fatal result of this process is that
the evidence for the separate existence of class 1, on which Keller lays
so much stress, tends to disappear. The only persistent members
of it are M and γ, both of them MSS. of the eleventh century.

It is interesting, however, to observe that whatever weight we
assign to Keller’s classification of the MSS. it has no revolutionary
effect upon his text. The great feature in it, after all, is the lower
value attached to such MSS. as B and V. This, of course, goes
far in some places to decide the reading. But if we compare his
text with that of the most competent and the most conservative
critics who immediately preceded him we shall find the difference
comparatively small. We shall see that he admits conjectures at
least as largely as others, more than many, and that his con-
clusions, however they were formed, are supported generally by
evidence from the Scholia, or by quotations, or by considerations
of style, metre, and the like ¹.

ξ 7. Before we leave the MSS. it may be the place to say a few

¹ Deducting questions of orthography, punctuation, &c., there are thirty-

seven places in the Odes and Epodes where Keller’s text (vol. i. of the
larger edition) differs from that of both Ritter and Munro. Of these nine

Δ are due to his introduction into the text of conjectures (Od. 1. 7. 8 ‘ honore,’

1. 15. 36 ⁴ Pergameas,’ 1. 16. 5 ‘adyti,' 1. 23. 5, 6 ‘ vepris . . . ad ventum,'

⁴ 3. 5. 15 ‘trahenti,‘ 4. 4. 17 ‘Raetis,’ 4. 10. 5 ‘Ligurine,’ Epod. 2. 27
'² ‘frondes,’ 5. 88 ‘humana invicem'). Eleven are cases where readings

testing on very slight MS. authority, or even upon none, have been
received on other grounds, such as the authority of the Scholia, &c.

j (Keller, Od. 1. 3. 37 ‘arduum,' 1. 16. 8 ‘si,’ 1. 20. 10 ‘tum,' 1. 22. 2

‘Mauri,' 1. 22. 11 ‘expeditus,’ 2. 3. 11 ‘quo et‚' 2. 6. 19 ‘fertilis‚’ 3. 3. 55
‘debacchantur’3 Ritter and Munro, 1. 17. 14 ‘hic,’ 2. 13. 23 ‘discretas,’
3. 4. 10 ‘ altricis ¹). There are very few of the remainder where the effect

,- of his view of the MSS. can be distinctly detected in the absence of other

arguments from the Scholia, or from internal evidence; such are perhaps
1. 8. 2 ‘hoc,' 3. 21. 1o ‘ necgleget,’ 4. 9. 31 ‘sileri,' Epod. 16. 33 ‘flavos,'
17. 60 ‘proderit.' In the later editions several of these variations are
retracted and the text is so much the more like that of previous editors-
