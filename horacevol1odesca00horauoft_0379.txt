lambs; when the trees shed their leaves to strew Faunus’ path,
and the ditcher revenges himself on the ground which has worked
him so hard, by dancing on it.

1. Nympharum amator. Faunus is identified with the Greek
Pan3 see on 1. 17. Perhaps the words imply that it is in pursuit
gf his flyiing loves that Faunus is supposed to cross the different

whom Faunus was supposed to frighten 3 Ritter, of the young trees
and plants which in his hot pursuit he might trample. Our
iiterpretation is supported both in this place and in 3. 23. 7, by
the words which follow. Faunus must be kindly to the flock,
because it pays tithe duly to him.

5. pleno anno, when the year is nearly full, in December; or,
perhaps, only like ‘per exactos annOS,’ 3. 22. 6 = ‘ quotannis,' at
mtervals of a full year.

6. Veneris sodali craterae, ‘the bowl, Venus’ mate.' Orelli
quotes an address to a flagon, Βάκχου καὶ Μουσέων ἶλαρὴ λάτρι καὶ
Κυθερείης. Ritter makes ‘ craterae ’ the genitive with ‘ vina,' ‘ wine
in the bowl,’ some particular bowl known to be set for Faunus, and
takes ‘ Veneris sodali ’ of the god himself.

7ἶ vetus implies that these rites have been duly performed ' “’

during many generations. Macleane puts a full stop at ‘ craterae,’
and makes the general description of the Faunalia begin here.

12. pagus. There is a curious variant in some of the good
MSS„ ‘pardus,’ the origin of which Bentley ingeniously traces to
some monkish copyist, who had in mind the prophecy of Isaiah,
11. 6 ‘ Habitabit lupus cum agno et pardus cum haedo accubabit?

14. spargit frondis. That the leaves were still falling in
December, see Epod. 11. 5 ‘ December . . . silvis honorem decutit!

agrestis, ‘ a woodland carpet ’ of leaves.

15. invisam, ‘invisam terram fossoribus merito dixit quod in ea
laborant cum fodiunt,’ Porph. See on Epp. 1. 14. 26.

pepulisse. For the perf. inf. with ‘ gaudet ’ see on 3. 4. 51 ; he
finishes off each triple beat with a flourish, as though he were
dancing on an enemy. .

fossor3 Virg. G. 2. 264 ‘ labefacta movens robustus iugera fossor?

16. ter, of triple time. Cp. 4. 1. 28 ‘In morem Salium ter
‘quatiecrlit humum! Perhaps Horace is offering an etymology of

tripu iare!
