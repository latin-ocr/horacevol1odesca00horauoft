BOOK IV, ODE Ι, 1-22

8. revooant, ‘ call you back,’ as to your proper place.

9. tempestivius, you will be a more timely guest there.

in domum. A rival reading with good support is ‘in domo’;
but her ‘car of swans’ implies that ‘comissari ' is used rather in
the Greek sense of κῶμος, a moving band of revellers or serenaders
(Theoc. 3. 1 κωμάσδω ποτὶ τὰν Ἀμαρυλλίδα), than in its more usual
Latin sense of a stationary revel. The reading ‘comissabere’
is quite certain, but the unusual word makes great havoc among
the copyists. Some of the best MSS. are at fault. ‘ Comis
habere,’ deomgtabere: ‘ commutabere,' ἃς. For the future tense
seeonO . 1. . 1.

10. Pauli Maximi. Two persons have been suggested as
possibly intended3 (1) Paulus Fabius Maximus, consul B.C. 11 ;
(2) his son or nephew‚ Ovid's patron, an intimate of Augustus, who
was consul twenty years afterwards. Of the two the second must
be thought the most likely. ‘ Puer' could hardly be used even
playfully of a man who must have been forty, and Ovid’s description
of the younger Paulus perhaps recalls the verses, Pont. 1. 2. 118
‘ Vox . . . tua . . . Auxilio trepidis quae solet esse reis.'

purpureis ales oloribus, ‘on the wings of lustrous swans,’ i. e.
in a chariot drawn by them. Od. 3. 28. 15. For ‘purpureis ’ see
on 3. 3. 12 ‘purpureo ore‚’ Virg. Aen. 1. 590 ‘lumenque iuventae
Purpureu1n.'

12. ieeur-3 1. 25. 15.

idoneum, perhaps another reminiscence of 3. 26. 1.

13. deoens; 1. 4. 6.

14. ⁴ No tongue-tied champion of trembling prisoners.' Cp. 2. 1.
13 ‘ insigne maestis praesidium reis.'

15. eentum artium, the descriptive genitive; Madv. ξ 287,
with obs. 3. 1t seems to have been almost a proverbial expression.
‘ Omnium artium puerulos‚’ Cic. Rosc. Am. 41. 120.

17. quandoque == ‘ quandocumque.’ Cp. Od. 4. 2. 34, A. P. 359.

potentior seems to some degree to continue the metaph. of
‘militiae tuae.’ ‘ So soon as he shall laugh triumphant over the
presents of his open-handed rival! His rival can give richer
presents; Paulus fights and vanquishes him with arms which
Venus lends him—beauty, youth, διε. ‘ Muneribus ' is the ablative
of comparison after ⁴ potentior.'

19. Albanos . . . lacus, where Paulus, it is implied, had a villa.
The title includes the Lago d'Albano and the Lago di Nemi.

20. ponet marmoream3 cp. Sat. 2. 3. 183 ‘aeneus ut stes‚’ and
the promise in Virg. E. 7. 31 ‘Si proprium hoc fuerit, levi de
marmore tota . . . stabis.’ χαλκοῦν τινὰ ἱστάναι is an expression of
Demosth„ as Fals. Leg. 425. 1.

citrea. The ‘ citrus‘ is mentioned by Pliny (N. H. 13. 16) as much
used in temples on account of the durability of the wood. What it
was is not so certain; apparently some kind of cypress or cedar;
certainly different from the citron.
