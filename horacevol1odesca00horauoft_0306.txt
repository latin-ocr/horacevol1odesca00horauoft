THE 0DEs or HORACE ’

’ corruption. Lachmann's correction ‘Thynus’ or ‘Thoenus’ is 4·

tempting. Bithynian commerce is often mentioned in Horace,
Carthaginian never3 and the Bithynian sailor's first difficulty would ἔ
be the passage of the Bosporus.

ultra caeca. If he can once pass that stormy strait (‘ gemens,’
Od. 2. 20. 14, ‘insaniens‚' 3. 4. 30) he does not fear dangers from
any other quarter, which are not less real because he does not see
them as plainly.

16. timet aliunde, for lengthening the short syllable see on Od.
1. 3. 36.

17. sagittas et fugam. The Roman soldier is said to sear just
what the Parthian is said to trust to, Virg. G. 3. 31 ‘ Fidentemque
fuga Parthum versisque sagittis,' ‘ arrows of the swistly flying
Parthian? Cp. Od. 1. 19. 11 ‘ Versis animosum equis.'

18. catenas et Italum robur, ‘ the chains of an Italian prison-
house.' ‘ Robur' was a name given to the ‘Tullianum’ ·or lower
dungeon of the Mamertine prison by the Capitol, where greater
criminals were confined before their execution (it is described in
Sall. Cat. 55), and where Jugurtha was starved to death (Plut.
Marius 12). The conjunction ‘catenas et robur ’ makes this mean-
ing inevitable‚ as in Lucr. 5. 1030 ‘verbera, carnificeS, robur, pix’;
Tac. Ann. 4. 29 ‘robur et saxum minitari.’ Dillr. would take it
in the simple sense of ‘the strength of Italy!

19. improfiea, predicative. ‚

20. rapuit rapietque, Od. 4. 2. 38 ‘nihil maius donavere nec
dabunt ’; Epp. 1. 2. 43 ‘labitur et labetur ’ ; 1. 7. 21 ‘tulit et feret&

gentis, used for ‘ mankind ’ as in 1. 3. 28 ‘ignem gentibus intulit’;
but specially appropriate here as Horace has been enumerating·
several nations who differ in their special scats, but all fall under
this one sentence.

21. furvae, a word meaning apparently ‘dark,’ appropriated in ·
use to the lower world and what belongs to it, the black victims.
sacrificed to the ‘Di inferi,' &c., Fest. s.v., A. Gell. 1. 18.

Proserpinae. This is the only place, except Sen. Herc. Fur.
548, in which the first syllable is shortened. Horace has it lon
elsewhere, Od. 1. 28. 20, Sat. 2. 5. 110.

22. Aeaeum, one of the three judges of Hades, Ov. Met. 13. 25
Plat. Gorg. p. 353.

23. discriptas. The MSS. vary between this reading, ‘ deseri
tas’ and ‘ discretas.’ The meaning is the same. Virg. Aen.
670 ‘ secretosque pios.’ ’

24. Aeoliis, Od. 4. 9. 12 ‘ Commissi calores Aeoliae fidib·

uellae.’
p 25 foll. The lyric poet would look first in the shadow—world fo ³
Sappho and Alcaeus, as Socrates (Plat. Apol. p. 41) imagines him
self looking for Palamedes and Ajax and other victims of unjus ¹
judgements.

25. puellis de popularibus, as not answering to her affection, ⁷ -
in Sapph. Fr. 43, &c.
