THE ODES OF HORACE

omnus!

Pudor, αἰδώς. According to the definition in A. Gell. 19. 6 2
‘timor iustae reprehensionis,' the sensitiveness to the judgement of ἱ

others, which makes a man modest, harmless, temperate.

7. Fides, defined by Cic. Off. 1. 7. 23 ‘ dictorum conventorumque .'
constantia et veritas,² and called there ‘iustitiae fundamentum.² ’-
In calling Good F aith or Honour the sister of Justice‚ Horace '

implies that the two go together, and therefore that both were
present in Quintilius.

nuda Veritas, as Acr. explains, ‘quae nihil occulti habeat ut ἶ
egeat tegumento.’ Ritter compares the picture of Quintilius, the .

candid critic of A. P. 438 foll. 3 see Introduction to this Ode.

8. inveniet, for the sing. verb after several subjectS, see Od. Tr

1. 3. 3.

1 1. frustra pius. Virgil, the gentle and reverent poet, has com-

mitted his friend to the safe keeping of the gods, little dreaming

how they would discharge the trust; now he asks back his‘ depo·
situm' (cp. Od. 1. 3. 5-8) only to fi’nd how fruitless his piety has ,
been. Another interpretation is that of LambinuS, ‘Thou askest .
Quintilius of the gods, and findest‚ despite thy piety‚ that he was

not lent to thee on such terms‚' i. e. that you should never part.

The first is probably right as assigning the same agent to ‘creditum’ ῖ
and‘ poscis, ’and as giving a more definite sense and connexion ἲ
with the context to ‘ frustra pius? With the thought of these words =
we may perhaps compare, as a characteristic difference between the ἒ,
two poets, Virgil’ s notice of the same moral difficulty, Aen. 2. 426— ¹
430, and his more reverent and religious comment, ‘Dis aliter

visum?
ita = ‘ hac condicione,’ on such terms as this.

13-15. quid si . . . num. The words ‘ frustra pius ’ have struck
the note which is the key to this stanza. ‘In vain—did I say ?— ¹
while he was alive. What if you had the persuasive lyre of Orpheus,

could it restore to us the dead ?’ For the construct10n‚ a hypo· ,

thetical question preceded by the interrogative or exclamatory

⁴ quid‚' cp. S. 2. 3. 159, Epp. 1. 19. 12, Virg. Aen. 4. 311. There is ξς

a reading of less authority, ‘ Quod si.’

15. vanae imagini. Cp. Virg. Aen. 6. 292 ‘tenuis sine corpore ἒ
vitas . . . volitare cava sub imagine formae.' The unsubstantial
forms, νεκύων εἴδωλα, in Hom. Od. 11, have to drink a draught of

blood before they can recover life enough ‘to talk with Ulysses.

17. lenis recludere, App. 2. ξ 2.

precibus, the dat. = ‘ in answer to.’

fata recludere, to open the door of fate. ‘Panditur ad nullas
ianua nigra preces,’ Prop. 4. 11. 2.

18. nigro compulerit gregi, has gathered to the black fold. For ⁵
the case, cp. Od. 1. 28. 10 ‘ Panthoiden iterum Orco demissum! .

Madv. ξ 251. For the image, Od. 2. 3. 25 ‘ omnes eodem cogimur.’
19. patientia, see Introduction to the Ode.
