draughts of Egyptian wine, for Bacchus too is the author of such
empty fears: cp. Eur. Bacch. 303 foll. στρατὸν γὰρ ἐν ὅπλοις ὅντα
κάπὶ τάξεσι Ι φόβος διεπτόησε πρὶν λόγχης θιγεῖν· Ι μανία δὲ καὶ τοῦτ’
ἐστὶ Διονύσου πάρα. It is opposed to ‘ veros timores‚’ ‘the fears of
soberness!

Mareotico, a sweet wine frorn Marea, a town of the Delta, men-
tioned but not characterized by Virg. G. 2. 91. Ι
16. ab Italia, not that she had reached Italy, but that it was the
object of the ambitious schemes broken down at Actium. A few of
Octavianus’ ships seem to have pursued Cleopatra for a short way,
but she escaped safely to Alexandria. Horace marks no interval

⁷²: between this and the autumn of the following year, when Octavia-

nus followed, to put a close to the war at Alexandria, and Antony
and Cleopatra escaped his hands by a voluntary death.

20. Haemoniae, poetical name of Thessaly, mythically derived
from Haemon, the father of Thessalus. The epithet probably only
implies ‘in winter,' the appropriate time for hunting. Sat. 2. 3. 234.

21. monstrum: quae, a common constructio ad sensum. Cicero
calls Catiline ‘ monstrum‚’ Cat. 2. 1 ; Lucan calls Cleopatra ‘ Latii
feralis Erinnys‚’ 10. 59.

22. nee . . . ensem. According to Plutarch (Ant. 79) she

· attempted to stab herself on the approach of Proculeius, Augustus'

emissary, but was prevented. The next line and a half have refer-

‘ enee perhaps to a plan which, on the same authority (ib. 69), she is

said to have entertained of carrying her fleet across the isthmus,
and escaping down the Red Sea.

24. reparavit, a word of doubtful sense, but found in all the
MSS. and interpreted by the Schol. Porph. took it as a pregnant
expression = ‘ ad latentis oras fugit ut vires inde repararet! It may
mean no more than ‘ found some fresh land out of the way of
Caesar's vengeance.² It may also mean (see on 1. 31. 12) ‘pur-

- chased,' ‘ used her fleet to win for herself‚’ and there may be in it

a more or less conscious remembrance of the Greek uses of ἀμείβειν
and ἀλλάττειν, for ‘to go to’ some new place. Bentley proposed
‘ penetravit‚’ and there have been many other conjectures, some of
thern astounding ones, as ‘ citare paravit,' ‘ ire paravit,' ἃς.

25. ausa et . . . fortis et. There is no verb understood. These
are the grounds of the foregoing statements, the infinitive following
‘fortis‚’ as in 1. 1. 18, &c.

iacentem, metaphorical = ‘ afflictam ac desolatam,’ Orelli.

26. asperas, 1. 23. 9.

28. combiberet, ⁴ drink the full draught.' The story of her
death by the bite of an asp was, according to Dion (51. 14), due to
conjecture. Some κεντὴματα λεπτά were found on her arm, which
were attributed by some to the bite of an asp, by some to a poisoned
needle. Suetonius also (Oct. 17) only says ‘ putabatur.’

29. deliberata, in the sense of Cicero’s ‘ certe statuere ac
deliberare‚’ Verr. 2. 1. 1.

30. Liburnis, dative. Their will, which she grudged them, is
