BOOK 1, ODE XXXI, 1-17

’⁴ stands in the lemma of Porph. If we read ‘ut’ there is a taunt
against the wine-grower who toils that other men may drink of his

, wine, as well as against the trader who risks his life for his gold
ν cups and rare wines. The irony would be not unlikely to attract an

ι emendator, but it seems beyond the requirements of this place.

eulullis, A. Ρ. 434, apparently used for ‘large cups.’ According
, to the Schol. they were originally ‘calices fictiles quibus pontifices
j virginesque Vestales in sacris utebantur.’
, 12. Syra reparata meroe, obtained by bartering Syrian wares.
s The meaning of ‘ reparo' seems to be ‘to obtain in exchange,' the
‘ re ' playing the partos ἀπὸ in ἀποδίδοσθαι (⁴ to give for a considera-
tion ⁹), ἀπαιτεῖν, &c. Forcell. quotes for the use two fragments of
Alfenus Varus and Scaevola contained in the Digest‚ ‘ alios boves

- his numis reparare,’ ‘messis reparare’; see on Od. 1. 37. 24

ῃ ‘latentis Classe cita reparavit oras! Bentley, denying this use of
‘ reparo,' alters that passage and interprets this, ‘condita vel medi-
cata Syriaco nardo‚’ referring to the Roman practice of mixing
spices and persumes with cenain wines. For the ‘ Syrian wares’
cp. Od. 3. 29. 60 ‘Tyriae merces.' These would consist of the

. produce of the East‚ amongst them of spices and perfumed oils.

valido is opposed to ‘senectam.’ He asks for the health and

'⁸3 strength to enjoy‚ as long as nature allows a man to look for health
· and strength, and when old age comes, for the solaces of old age.
· This double purpose of ‘valido,' fixing the time as well as asking

for the necessary condition of ‘frui' (‘while I am strong and because

“ I am strong '), will explain the reason why ‘et' is joined to it,

although grammatically it qualifies ‘frui ’ and answers to ⁶ nec (= et
non) turpem senectam degere.’ For ‘ et . . . nec,' cp. Cic. Brut. 4.

modo,' &c. ‘ At ’ has been altered with some slight MS. authority
to ‘ ac ’ and to ‘ et.’ ‘ Et valido et integra cum mente,’ which Orelli
and others accept, would give a more flowing sentence, and a more
