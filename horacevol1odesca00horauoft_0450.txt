THE ODES OF HORACE

and honorary titles will be sufficient for his merits. The force of -

the adjective must overflow on the other clauses, as the general
thought is, ‘ how can we adequately honour you now, or secure you
the immortality of honour which you deserve ? ’ A genitive of the
object with ‘munus’ is not common; but cp.· 1. 28. 3 ‘pulveris
exigui munera.'

ἓ. titulos, inscriptions on monuments and public buildings ;
4· Ῑ3·

memores fastos; 3. 17. 4.

5. aeternet, an archaic word, found' in a fragment of Varro.

qua = ‘over the whole space in which? Ov. Met. 1. 241 ‘qua
terra patet fera regnat Erinnys,’ Virg. Aen. 7. 99 ‘nepotes Omnia
sub pedibus, qua Sol utrumque recurrens Aspicit Oceanum, vertique
regique videbunt.’

habitabilis oras: a translation of‘ η οἰκουμένη. ’ .

6. maxime principum, not as though ‘ princeps’ had yet become
a general title for a ruler in any time or people, as we might say
‘greatest of princes,’ but only a hyperbolical form of ‘maxime
princeps! It is himself and his own office that is generalized:
Horace cannot conceive a greater than him in his own character.
For the title ‘ princeps ’ see on 1. 2. 50.

7. quem . . . didicere . . . quid possea, a familiar idiom in Greek,
Soph. Ο. Τ. 15 ὁρᾷς μὲν ἡμᾶς ἡλίκοι προσ-ἥμεθα, the subject of the
subordinate verb being attracted into the accusative, as though it
were the direct object of the leading verb. It is imitated frequently
by Terence, as in Eun. 3. 5. 18 ‘me noris quam elegans siem,’
Madv. § 439, obs. 1. The general expression ‘ didicere quid posses ’
answers to 4. 4. 2 5—27 ‘ sensere quid . . . posset.’

9. milite tuo; cp. v. 33.

10. Genarmos, Breunos, two Raetian tribes. The name of the
first is thought to be still traced in the Val di Non, which runs
N .W. from the valley of the Adige at S. Michele, half-way between
Trent and Botzen ; the second in the name of the Brenner Pass
itself, and the town of Brunecken.

implacidum, a word not found before Horace.

11. veloces, moving swiftly from place to place.

13. deiecit, a word specially applicable to the forts built on the
brink of precipices (v. 0132) so that it has here something of the effect
of a zeugma, though it is a usual word for ‘dislodging’ an enemy.
E p. 2. 2. 0.

{ssus vige simplici. ‘ Quia dupla quam dederant clade perculsi
sunt,' Porph., ‘with more than a bare requital (⁶⁴ vicem reddere ”)‚’
‘ with heavy interest.’ It corresponds to ‘sine clade‚' v. 32. Lambinus
understood it as = ‘more than once.’ ‘ Plus’ = ‘plus quam’; cp.
1. 13. 20 ‘ suprema citius die,’ ‘ sooner than on the last day?

14. maior Neronum, Tiberius3 see Introd. to the Book.

17. spectandus . . . quantis, θαυμαστὸς . . . ὅσοις, a brachylogy
less common in Latin than in Greek. For its ffel in bringing the
relative clause into closer relation with the leading clause we may
