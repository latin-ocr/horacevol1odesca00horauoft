GENERAL IN TRODUCTION

can appeal to determine a disputed reading contains in every
department some element of uncertainty‚ and is not likely to be
rated at the same relative value by all critics. The best MSS.
at times give impossible readings. There are unsettled questions
as to the independent value of particular MSS. The Scholia show
manifest signs both of corruption and of interpolation. They
support sometimes readings which metre or sense forbids ¹. They
sometimes differ from one another as to the text ², and report
differences as existing earlier still ⁸.

It must not be supposed however that the criticism of Horace’s
text, any more than the criticism of other classical texts, turns·
entirely on the testimony of MSS. or Scholia. However sar these
carry us back, they leave us, on the one hand, with the certainty
that varieties of reading existed, and that emendation on gram-
matical or other grounds had been at work already: and on
the other hand they leave, if not very many blots which modern
criticism has unanimously recognized and corrected, yet enough of
these ⁴ to make us feel that when the question lies between an z· and
an e or an a, one or other expansion of an ambiguous abbreviation ⁵,

³ For the testimony of the Scholiasts to various readings found by them
in their MSS. see on Od. 2. 6. 24, Sat. 2. 1. 79, Epp. 2. 2. 80, A. Ρ. 190.

¹ The unmetrical ‘ tricenis ’ Od. 2. 14. 5, ‘laborem ⁹ Epod. 1. 15,
‘cubitale’ Sat. 2. 3. 255 have overwhelming MS. support. The mistakes
in proper names are notorious, e. g. the Scholiasts show by their quotations
from Homer that they had the right name in Od. 3. 20. 15, Epod. 15. 22,
but all known MSS. but one has ‘ Nereus: ‘ Nerea.' The certain form
‘ Alyattei' in Od. 3. 16. 41 has had to be restored by modern scholars, the
MSS. being hopelessly at sea.

⁵ An illustration of this as a disturbing cause in the text of MSS. is
probably to be seen in Epod. 4. 8, where all the MSS. but one read ‘ ter’
though the sense absolutely requires ‘ trium.’ The clue is given in B which
stands alone in reading t'. A similar misunderstanding, no doubt, led
to the reading ‘inter’ instead of ‘ intra’ in Epp. 2. 2. 114, ‘hic . . . illi ’
instead of ‘huic . . . ille' in Epp. 2. 2. 89. And this is the explanation
also of the hesitation of MSS. between different forms, as ‘ hic ' and ‘ hinc ’
Od. 1. 17. 14, ‘ ad hunc ’ and ‘ adhuc' Epod. 9. 17, ‘ quod' ‘quia ' ‘qui’
Od. 1. 12. 3, ‘quo’ ‘ quod ' ‘quos ’ C. S. 5, ‘demoveas’ ‘dimoveas' Od.
1. 1. 13, ‘ distinet ' ‘detinet‘ ⁶ destinet ¹ Od. 4. 6. 10 and the like.
