THE ODES OF HORACE

sidere duci: Nostra vel aequali suspendit tempora libra Parca
tenax veri, seu nata fidelibus hora Dividit in geminos concordia
fata duorum, Saturnumque gravem nostro Iove frangimus una·
Nescio quod, certe est quod me tibi temperat astrum! Compare
also for the influence attributed to some of the planets and signs of
the Zodiac here named, Propert.4. 1. 83 foll. ‘F elicesque Iovis
stellas Martisque rapacis Et grave· Saturni sidus in omne caput;
Quid moveant Pisces animosaque signa Leonis, Lotus et Hesperia
quid Capricornus aqua? Each planet had a special relation to
some sign of the Zodiac; Venus to Libra, Mars to Scorpio, Saturn
to Ca ricornus.

asppieit, the present tense, as the influence of the star which was
in the critical position at the moment of the child' s birth continues
throu h his life.

18.gpare violentior, ‘more stormy influence in the hour of
birth'; Manil. 4. 217 foll. ‘ Scorpios armatae metuendus cuspide
caudae . . . In bellum ardentis animos et Martia corda Efficit et
multo gaudentem sanguine Sullam?

19. tyrannus Hesperiae undae, cp. Propert. l. c. Horace
probably gives this title (cp. ‘arbiter Hadriae? 1.3. 15) to Capri-
corn as the mid· winter sign. Cic. Nat. D. 2. 44 (from Aratus)
‘ Tum gelidum valido de pectore frigus anhelans Corpore semifero
magno Capricornus in orbe: Quem cum perpetuo vestivit lumine
Titan Brumali flectens contorquet tempore currum.’ The ‘ western
waters,’ as in Od. 1. 28. 26. Lord Ly tton thinks that in suggesting
Capricorn for his horoscope Horacey is thinking of his own narrow
escape from shipwreck, Od. 3. 4. 28.

22. impio connects the crimes of the mythological Saturn with
the bad influence of the planet which bears his name. Orelli shows Ἀ
from Manil. 2. 434 and 4. 698 that‘ tutela’ was a technical term. .

23. Saturno. The dative probably feels the government both of
‘ eripuit ’ and of ‘ refulgens’ in the sense of ⁴ shining in the face of,’
so as to counteract his influence.

26. ter, indefinite, of several rounds of applause. The plural
‘ theatris ' generalizes, ‘the people in crowded theatres’; in Od. 1.
20. 3, where he refers to the event more particularly, he uses the
singular. We need not press the fact that there was at the time
apparently only one theatre in Rome. For the phrase ‘ crepuit
sonum ’ cp. Propert. 3. 10. 4 ‘ manibus faustos ter crepuere sonos.’

27. truncus, Od. 2. 13 passim, 3. 4. 27, 3. 8. 8.

28. sustulerat. The indicative is a rhetorical exaggeration, ‘1 ·“
was dead, had not Faunus stayed the blow,' cp. Od. 3. 16. 3

‘munierant. .si non risissent’ ; Virg. G. 2. 133, Aen 2. 553 see ,
Madv. 8 c.
Εαιιὲηἱ4 cp. 1. 17. 2, 13, the god of the country, here probably

as there identified with Pan, for Pan was the son of Hermes, which ¹

may explain the connexion of‘ Mercurialium! Horace attributes
his escape in 3. 8. 7 to Bacchus: the constant part in all his
references to it is its ground, ‘ Dis pietas mea Et musa cordi est.’
