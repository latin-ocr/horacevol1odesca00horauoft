‘q BOOK 1, ODE XI, I—ODE XII, 25

Ἰ It links his name too closely to the Julian house to have been

¹- written before Augustus had given unmistakeable proof of his

intentions towards him. lt is natural to think of his betrothal and
y marriage to Julia in Β. c. 25. See on v. 47.

- 1. lyra vel aeri tibia, see on Od. 1. 1. 32, and on 3. 4. 1.
f , 2. sumis celebrare, App. 2. ξ 1.

⁴ Clio, see on Od. 1. 1. 32.

3-6. Clio is to sing, not Horace, and so the song will be sung 1n

2 the Muses' haunts on Helicon (in Boeotia), on Pindus (in Thessaly,

,s Virg. E. 10. 11), or on Haemus, the old home of Orpheus (in

ς’ Thrace, Virg. G. 2. 488).

ἑ 3. iocosa imago, Od. 1. 20. 73 in neither case is any specially

f freakish echo intended.

“ 5. oris, not confined to the seashore, Od. 1. 26. 4.

. 7-13. A reminiscence of the power of song. He implies‚ ‘let

,ἔ your song be such as that!

·' 7. temere, ‘pell-mell,’ ‘ nullo ordine,’ in their hurry to hear.

9. arte materna, Calliope’s, Virg. E. 4. 57.

’ 11. blandum ducere, App. 2. ξ 2.

ἑ 13. dicam, a usual word with Horace for ‘ canere‚' ‘praedicare,’
cp. Od. 1. 17. 19, 1. 19. 12, 1. 21. 1, 3. 4.1, &c.

' parentis, ‘the sire' of gods and men. The v. l. ‘parentum,’

ᾗ was due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the Ode, as

g though it was simply to ‘ praise famous men and the fathers who

”7 begat us.’ With the ‘ Quid prius dicam?’ cp. Virg. E. 3. 60 ‘ Ab

ΐ Iove principium, Musae,’ Theoc. 17. 1 ; and for the whole order of
the objects of the poet's praises, cp. 4. 15. 28-32 ‘deos . . . virtute

ν functos duces . . . progeniem Veneris.'

: 14. qui res, δια, Virg. Aen. 1. 230 ‘O qui res hominumque

3 deumque Aeternis regis imperiis.’

15. mundum, surrounding space.
16. horis, like the Gr. ὥραις, ‘ seasons'3 so again A. P. 302 ‘sub
verni temporis horam!

. . 17. unde, ‘from whom,' of a person, Od. 1. 28. 28, Sat. 1. 6. 12,

5 2. 6. 21. The Schol. quote Virg. Aen. 1. 6 ‘ genus unde Latinum.'

⁷9 Cp. the use of ‘ undique,’ Od. 1. 7. 7.

'a 18. secundum, Cic. Brut. 47. 173 ‘ nec enirn in quadrigis eum

’ζ secundum numeraverim aut tertium qui vix e carceribus exierit

ς cum palmam iam primus acceperit.’

Δ 21. proeliis audax. Bentley, followed by Ritter, puts the stop
after instead of before these words, making them an epithet of
Pallas, who is pre—eminently ‘ Armipotens,' ‘ Bellipotens‚’ &a But
Bacchus is ‘ idem pacis mediusque belli ’ in Od. 2. 19. 28.

22. Virgo, Diana, the huntress.

2 5. Alciden puerosque Ledae. A comparison of Od. 3. 3.
9 foll. ‘ Hac arte Pollux et vagus Hercules' (cp. also Od. 4. 5. 35)
and Epp. 2. 1. 5foll., seems to show that here also a comparison 1s
hinted between Augustus and the heroes named. The calming
