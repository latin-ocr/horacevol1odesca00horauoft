THE ODES OF HORACE

recur in the Odes (especially 5 and 15) of Book iv, which celebrate
the resorms as accomplished.

¹ Metre— Third A sclepiad.

1. intactis, ‘ unrifled.'
2. Arabum, 1. 29. 1. 1
3. caementis, 3. 1. 35.

4. Tyrrhenum Apulioum. So I have printed, not from any
confidence in the text, but rather that, in default of conclusive
evidence on the subject, this reading seems to have acquired a
certain right of possession from the favour of several generations of
editors. ‘Apulicum’ has the least MS. authority; it does not
explain the variants, and there is the difficulty of the quantity of its
first syllable, which is never found certainly short, unless in the
disputed passage in Od. 3. 4. 10. The chief var. lect. are (1)
⁴ Ponticum,’ the reading of B. Keller thinks it a ‘ Mavortian'
alteration. The whole expression then would mean, ‘the sea from
end to end of the civilized world, from Rome to the Euxine.’ (2)
‘ publicum‚’ which was the reading of V. It must mean ‘ the com-
mon property os all,’as in Ov. Met. 6. 351 ‘ usus communis aquarum
est. N ec solem proprium Natura nec aera fecit, N ec tenues undas;
ad publica munera veni.’ The difficulty m its way is that it seems
to carry with it the necessity for the alteration of‘ Tyrrhenum?
No local name will correspond to it. Lachmann (011 Lucr. 1. 360)
conjectured‘ terrenumss which occurs in the sense of‘ land’ in Liv.
23. 19, and Keller, Kiessling and Munro (the last grudgingly) accept
it. The name ‘Tyrrhenum’ appears as ‘Tirrenum' in several good
MSS, though this 15 not more misspelling than 15 to be looked for
with proper names. The Schol. of Aer. and Porph. is favourable
to the conj„ though it does not require it, ‘invehitur 111 luxuriam
omnia profanantem et aedificiis novis non terram tantum sedetiam
maria occupantem! The full expression would then be, ‘Every
inch of dry land and the sea the common heritage of all.’ Cp. 2.
15.1—4,2—18,2o-22 ‘ parum locuples continente ripa’, ·.3 1. 36

‘dominus terrae fastidiosus? There is an ingenious, but, not con-
vincing conjecture of Prof. Palmerin Class. Review, 5. p. 141. He
accepted Lachmann’ s ‘’terrenum and suggested that the last word of
the verse was ‘ sublicis, ' which was itself corrupted into ‘ publicum:
and by a gloss‘ pontium’ gave rise to‘ Ponticum!

5-8. The image in this place is not clear. We may perhaps
compare 2.18.29. In both cases Horace is pointing the irony of
fate, which allows a man to begin to build what he may not live to
finish. In each case ‘Orcus' or Necessitas is represented
under images borrowed from the employment of the rich man
himself. In 2.18 he is busy planning his palace. Death has his
measuring rod too, and 15 planning a home for him which he shall
yet more surely tenant. Here heis laying the foundations of his -ss
palace deep in the sea· , but who knows that F ate may not snatch ξ
his hammer from him and ‘ drive the last nails into the gable-top ’
