INDEX OF METRES

Horace twice allows an elision of a hypermetric syllable at the end
of the third verse, 2. 3. 27 and 3. 29. 35. There is ananalogous
licence taken in the Asclepiad metre in 4. 1. 35, and Virgil allows
it in the hexameter, Georg. 1. 295, &c.

ξ 3. The Sapphic stanza is found in twenty-five Odes :—-
l 1. 2, 10, 12, 20, 22, 25, 30, 32, 383
ν 2. 2, 4, 6, 8,10‚ 163
s 3. 8, 11, 14, 18, 2ο, 22, 27;
'3 4. 2, 6, 113
and in vthe Carm. Saec.
It employs two kinds of verse, the lesser Sapphic‚ which is
repeated three times—
-ιι---κιιι-ιι-Ξζ

and the Adonic—

-ικιι-Ξέ

The materials of the rhythm in this are the same as in the
Alcaic. It is a sequence of trochees and dactyls. This is obscured

> in Horace, (1) by his excluding the trochee absolutely from the

second place, where it is often found in Sappho, and in her first
Latin imitator, Catullus, αῖ δὲ μὴ φιλεῖ ταχέως φιλήσει, ‘ Pauca
nuntiate meae puellae ’ 3 (2) by his eschewing the break before the
dactyl, φαίνεταί μοι κῆνος ἴσος· θεοῖσιν, ‘Ille mi par esse deo videtur!
The lengthening of the short syllable in 2. 6. 14, ‘Angulus ridet,
ubi non Hymetto,' is perhaps a trace of the feeling that, as the first

syllable of· the dactyl, it had the metrical accent upon it.

The caesura falls commonly, in the first three Books„after the
fifth syllable, ‘ Iam satis terris,’ though it is found, from time to
time, after the sixth‚ ⁴ Quem virum aut heroa-⁵ In the Carm. Saec.
and the Fourth Book, Horace returns in this point to the use of
Catullus and the Greek, and employs the second caesura frequently.
In either the three Sapphic Odes of Book F our together, or in the
Carm. Saec. alone, there are twice as many instances of it as in the
twenty-one Odes of the earlier Books.

There is no synaphea, but hypermetric syllables are occasionally
elided at the end of all the first three verses of the stanza (2. 2. 18,
2. 16. 34, 4. 2. 22, 23, C. S. 47). By Sappho the Adonic was treated
as isit scanned continuously with the verse before, and this use is
preserved in Horace to some extent, a word beingat times divided
between them (ι. 2. 19, 1. 25. 11, 2. 16. 7). On the other hand, we
gud a hiatus at times, as in 1. 2. 47 ‘ Neve te nostris vitiis iniquum

, cior aura.’

ξ 4. Iambt'c metres.
Of these two occur in Horace :—
( 1) The common Senarius or Iambic TrImeter (for the name
see Ars Poet. 2 52) in Epod. 17- ' . ’
’ . (2) Couplets of the Senarius and an Iambic Dimeter in Epod.
