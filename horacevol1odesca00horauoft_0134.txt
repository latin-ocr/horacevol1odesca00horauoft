INTRODUCTION TO THE

no longer the patron to whose praise Horace looks as his highest
reward. The three Books of Odes have been published for some
time, and the verdict anticipated in 3. 30 has been accorded to ⁷
them. Their author is now the 'intimate of Augustus. He has
been selected to compose the hymn for the Secular Games, and the
public voice ratified the emperor’s choice. He is now writing,
not in the hope of winning a name for himself, but at the desire of
AugustuS‚ and because his praise will confessedly give lustre to the
emperor and his family.

It may be added, that the versification of the leading Odes gives
some witness to the lateness of their composition ; the Sapphic
Odes in the frequeney of the caesura after the sixth syllable, which
assimilates them to the Carm. Sace., · and the Alcaic in the greater
strictness with respect to the structure of v. 3 of the stanza‚ and the
complete exclusion of the short anacrusis in vv. 1, 2, 3 (see Index
of Metres).

It has been said before that Book iv exhibits more proofs of
artistic purpose in its arrangement than any other collection of
Horace’ 5 poems. ·

1. The most obvious instance, perhaps, is the disposition of the
four Odes for the sake of which we may say the Book was com-
posed. They stand in two pairs at the beginning of the Book
(after a prelude, which will be noticed presently) and at its end.
Each pair is divided between Augustus and one of the young
princes; so that any praises of the latter may seem to lead up
to and merge themselves 1n the glory of the former.

2. Scarcely less noticeable is the sequence of thought expressed
or suggested in the three Odes which precede the main theme.
