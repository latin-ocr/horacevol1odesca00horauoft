ODE XIV

WRITTEN on the return of Augustus, in B.C. 24, from his cam-
paign in Spain, the last few months of which he had spent in
&affini-⁵52 {trigas-raca The Ode may be compared for its subject

‘Caesar is coming back a conqueror, like Hercules, from his
dangerous expedition to Spain. Prepare a public supplicatio. His
wife Livia, his sister Octavia, mothers who are recovering their
sons-in—law or sons, the sons themselves and their young wives, all
have their parts to play. Ι shall keep my private holiday too,
for I feel the peace and security of Caesar’s rule. Unguents, boy,
and a garland, and a cask of the oldest wine, and go and call
Neaera. If you can’t get admittance to her, come away ; we shall
enjoy ourselves without her, though I should not have been so easy

seventeen years ago!

With the end of the Ode compare that of 1. 36 ancl 2. 11. The
point of the last stanzas lies in the words ‘eximet curas,' v. 14.
The reason is given and then the feeling is exemplified.

1. Herculis ritu, Hercules was a favourite mythical prototype
of Augustus; cp. 3. 3. 9, 4. 5. 36, Virg. Aen. 6. 802 ‘Nec vero
Alcides tantum telluris obivit ἐ but here there is special reference
(1) to the title ‘ Hercules Victor ' under which he was worshipped
in Rome, (2) to his journey into Spain after the oxen of Geryones.

modo . . . morte, a moment ago our thoughts were all on the
danger of his expedition, now they are on the triumph of his return.

plebe, explained by Kiessling of the ‘plebs urbana.’ Augustus
is said in the Monum. Ancyr. to have distributed 3 ‘congiarium’
among the populace of Rome in his tenth consulship, that isin the
present year, 24 Β. c.

2. morto venalem. Macleane well quotes Aesch. in Ctes.§ 160

C ἲ ἴ

, αἵματός ἐστιν η apert] ὧνίαε ‘morte' meaning here, as αἵματος there,

not necessarily the shedding of one's blood, but the risk' of shedding
it: cp. ‘mortemque volunt pro laude pacisci‚' Virg. Aen. 5. 230.

5. unico gaudens marito, ‘ whose whole joy is in her husband';
as though in identifying Livia the poet would compliment her as
3 Roman matron of the old type of conjugal loyalty. To take
‘ unico' as = ‘ egregio’ would anticipate and reduce to a bathos the
epithet ‘clari ducis! That the reference is to Livia, not to faithful
wives generally, is clear from the mention of Augustus' sister
in v. 7.

6. operata, probably to be taken as ‘solata’ in Virg. G. 1. 293
(see Conington’s note) as a present participle, ‘come forth and
sacrifice.’ For ‘ operari ’ in this technical sense, like ‘ facere,’ ῥέζειν,
cp. Virg. G. 1. 339 ‘ Sacra refer Cereri laetis operatus in herbis.’
