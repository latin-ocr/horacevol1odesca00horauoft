INDEX OF METRES

ὲ Horace does not observe the law of the Greek Tragic Senarius in
re'st-lp‘e'ct o'f ags'hort syllable before a'final cretic' ; see e. ξ. Epod. 1.‘27
ari·-29.‚·1- ⁷· ³ · ’ ,

Three instances occur of an'apparent anapa'est in the fifth place :
Epod. 2. 35 ‘laqueo‚’ 5. 79 ‘inferius,’> 11. 23 ‘mulierculam' 3 but
Meineke rightly explained them as instances of synizesiS, or using
e and τ’ as semivowels, after the analogy of ‘ aurea ' in Virg. Aen.
1. 669ἑὲ, and of ‘consilium’ and ‘principium’ in Od. 3. 4. 41 and

ξ 5. These metres account for 97 out of the 104 Odes (including
the-Carm. Saea), and 11 out of 17 Epodes.

Of the remaining metres, one or at the most two or three speci-
mens exist, which are to be viewed rather, as Munro remarks, as
experiments. Δ

5. Alcmanium‚ Od. 1. 7 and 28, and Epod. 12.

It is in couplets consisting of the ‘common Dactylic Hexameter
and a DactylicTetrameter. θ ’ “ -

as the lambelegus combined in a different order.

Archilochium Ivtum, Od. 1. 4.

, (a) A verse called Archilochius Major, consisting of a Dactylic
Tetrameter÷three trochees. It is not in Horace asy-
nartete, for the fourth dactyl is always perfect, and no
hiatus is found; but there is a strict caesura between
the two parts of the verse.

(β) An Iambic Trimeter Catalectic.

7. Two couplets called Pythiambic, from the name Πύθιος, given

to the Hexameter as the metre of the Delphic oracles.

Epod. 14, 15.

¹ ἀσυνάρτητος, the term used for a verse of which the two parts are im-

perfectly joined together, where the last syllable of the first half is inde· ⁸:
pendent in scansion of the first syllable os the‘second half, e. g. Epod. 13, ν

8, 10, and 11. 6, 14. In this last case there is an actual hiatus.
