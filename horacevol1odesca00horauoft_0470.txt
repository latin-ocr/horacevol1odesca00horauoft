EPODE IV

A VIOLENT attack on some freedman, who moved the wrath of
Horace and of the citizens by his display and arrogance. ‘ A little
while ago flogged as a slave ε now with a fine estate in Campania,
a pony-carriage on the Appian way, and a seat at spectacles among
the “ equites '' l With what face do we fit our fleets against Sextus
Pompey and his runaway slaves, if we let a man of the same stamp
hold the rank of “tribunus militum'' ?'

and friend of Sextus Pompeius (see on Od. 3. 16. 16), who, in B.C. 38,
being then in command of a fleet and of the island of Sardinia,
deserted to Octavianus, and was received by him with great
honour: Dion 48. 45 ἐν τιμῇ μεγάλῃ ἤγαγε δακτυλίοις τε χρυσοῖς
ἐκόσμησε καὶ ἐς τὸ τῶν ἱππέων τέλος ἐσέγραψε. Suetonius (Oct. 74)
mentions him as the only ‘libertinus ' whom Augustus ever invited

service of his old master, but again deserted to Octavianus, and
was received, if not to confidence. yet to employment. He died in
