that a misunderstanding of the first line of the stanza (as though
the point was that given good children you may be sure they had
good parents, instead of, as it is, that given good parents you may
be sure of good children) led to the false punctuation of many MSS.
and editions, which put a comma after ⁴ fortibus ' ; so that ‘ bonis ’
becomes an epithet of ‘ iuvencis‚' and the sentiment of v. 30, instead
of being general, ‘good blood tells in bullocks and in horses,' is
narrowed to ‘good bullocks and horses owe their good qualities to
their sires.’ As Bentley observes, if this were right, the eagles and
the doves ought to change cases, for the important fact then would
‘lie that a dove did not breed eagleS‚ not that eagles did not breed
oveS.

30. eet, ⁴ survives,⁰ is something real.

35, 36. When there is a collapse of public manners (so that good
εξιιοειῐίοῃ becomes impossible), good birth is no protection against
t e taint.

38. Metaurum flumen, as ‘fiumen Rhenum,’ A. P. 18. The
battle of the Metaurus (a river of Umbria) was fought in B.C. 207,
by the consuls C. Claudius Nero and M. Livius Salinator (both
ancestors of Drusus, one through his father, the other through his
mother, Livia), against Hasdrubal, who was bringing reinforce-
ments to his brother Hannibal; Liv. 27. 45 foll.

39. pulcher d1e33 4. 2. 46 ‘ O Sol pulcher! ’ The daylight is at
once literal and metaphorical.

41. qui primus, the first day of brightness and victory since
Hannibal began his campaign in Italy. There might have been
victories before, as that of Nola gained by M. Claudius Marcellus

- in B.c. 2153 but this was the first decisive victory, the turning-

point of the war. Appian (p. 344, De Bell. Annib.) speaks of it as
ἰσοστάσιον [τῇ ἐπὶ Κάνναις ἀτυχίᾳ].

adorea. The recognized meaning of ‘adorea,’ was ‘glory won
in war,' and it was derived from ‘ ador ’==‘ corn.’ ‘ Gloriam . . . a
farris honore adoream appellabant,' Plin. N. H. 18. 3. The original
connexion is more doubtful. Pliny explains it of the donative of
corn given to the soldiers after a victory, N. H. 2. 18. Festus, s.v.‚
refers it, like such words as ‘pecunia‚' to an agricultural age:
‘adoream laudem sive gloriam dicebant quia gloriosum eum
putabant esse qui farris copia abundaret.’ Servius on Virg. Aen.
10. 677, has a still wilder derivation for it, from ‘ adoro.'

ut, ‘ ever since‚’ as in Epod. 7. 19, Cic. Brut. 5. 19 ‘ut illos libros

43. een. This is the only place where this word is used by
Horace. The images are of the speed and victoriousness of
Hannibal’s progress: ‘like fire through a pine-forest, or the east
wind sweeping the Sicilian sea? ·

44. Siculas; see on 2. 12. 2. Horace may be referring to his
own experience (see 3. 4. 28), but it is also possible that both the
