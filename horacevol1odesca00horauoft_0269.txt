BOOK I, ODE XXXV, 19-28

the interpretation of the symbols to the unassisted efforts of the
mind. The epithets are an integral part of his description, and
they give at every turn the moral meaning which sculpture or
painting could only indirectly convey. As Orelli remarks, ‘aena
manu' is an addition which poetry only could have ventured to
make, for it involves a figure within the figure. The very sameness
from this point of view has some force. Horace gives us a very

,, detailed picture, but in every feature he bids us see one and the

same awful character.

21. albo velata panno. The image seems to be taken from
the actual custom which was observed by the priests who sacrificed
to Fides of veiling their hand in a white eloth, the symbol expressing
apparently at once secrecy (contrast Od. 1. 18. 10 ‘arcani Fides
prodiga pellucidior vitro ⁹) and guilelessness.

rara, i. e. rarely found. The epithet really reminds us that
loyalty is a quality, and so impairs the personification‚ cp. Od.

ν 2. 16. 21.

22. comitem abnegat, ‘denies thee a companion‚’ i.e. the only
companion whom she could deny, viz. herself. Ovid, possibly in
imitation, ‘Si qua repugnarat nimium comitemque negarat' (sc.
se), A. A. 1. 127. For the sing. verb see on Od. 1. 3. 10.

24. inimica. It can hardly be denied that some confusion in
the allegory is brought to the surface by this epithet. In this
stanza at least F ortune is not a power wholly external to the person
who suffers or rejoices, but rather the genius of his life, ‘mortalis
in unum-Quodque caput, vultu mutabilis.' This is quite clear from
its first lines, for Hope and loyal friends are said to cling to her
when she changes her garb and leaves the home of greatness.
Hope and loyal friends are consolations of adversity, so that
Horace must mean not that they go with Fortune when she deserts
a man, but that they cling to him, to his changed estate as to his
unchanged. Yet if this is the case, in what sense is she said to be
‘inimica’? On whom does she frown? A man deserted by
’ Fortune, suffering under the illtreatment of Fortune, is a common
picture, but it is a conception of F ortune which, if it suits the
earlier stanzas of the Ode, is at variance with the general tone of
this one. F ortune‚ according to this, does not drive the great man
from his palace, nor fly from him and leave him in it to calamity, but
goes with him. She ‘changes her garb,' but only as he would
himself3 it is the common Roman habit of putting on a sad-
coloured dress in a time of missortune (cp. Epod. 9. 28 ‘punico
Lugubre mutavit sagum ’).

26. cadis siccatiS, cp. the Greek proverb ζεῖ χύτρα ζῇ φιλία.

28. ferre iugum pariter dolosi. ‘F erre' depends not on the
whole idea of ‘ dolosi‚’ but on the positive attribute which is denied
in it. ⁴ Not honest in bearing‚’ ‘no loyal yoke-fellows.’ The
metaphoris common. The yoke sometimes, as perhaps here, has
a reference to the labours or troubles that friendship shares and
lightens. Aesch. Ag. 842 ἕτοιμος· ἦν ἐμοὶ σειραφόρος, St. Paul, Phil.
