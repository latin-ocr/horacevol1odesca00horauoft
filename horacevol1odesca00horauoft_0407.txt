the coming metaphors. ⁴ The present, if you yourself are equable,
may be kept in some order: the future is like a rushing river—
it may be calm in its strength: it may be flooded and carrying
everything before it? The vagueness of ‘ quod adest' and‘ cetera?
suggests that they include nearness and farness of place as well as
time, and so form something of a link between vv. 25— —28 and
what follows. ‘You‚ Maecenas, are scheming about the distant
and the future; but the present in all senses is all that we can
contro .

34. alveo. Some good MS'S. have ‘aequore.’ But ‘ bed' is more
appropriate here than ‘ surface. ’

35. eum paoe; Madv. §257, obs. 2.

Etruscum. F’or the elision cp. 2. 3. 27.

36. adesos, worn or broken by the stream, ους τε κυλίνδωνὶ
χειμάρρους ποταμὸς μεγάλαις περιέξεσε δίναις. Mitsch. compares ‘levia
saxa’1.17. 12.

39'. elamore, as Virg. Aen. 3. 566 ‘Ter scopuli clamorem inter
cava saxa dedere? and Hom. Il. 17. 265’ ηῒόνες βοόωσιν.

4o.d11uV1es, 4.14.28. A poetical word for the usual‘ dilu-
vium.’

41. amnis, the rivers generally, or possibly the lesser streams
that feed the river of which we are speaking.

potens 8111, ἐγκρατὴς ἑαυτοῦ, αὐτάρκης.

42. ιιιᾶιοῑῑι, as Bentley pointed out, w1th dixisse? not with‘ vixi.’

43. dixisse, a simple perfect, see on 3. 4. 51. It is the net
result when each day is summed up.

vixi; Virg. Aen. 4. 653. Seneca (Ben.5. 17) seems to put the
two passages together, ‘Quis extremo die dicere audet: Vixi et
quem· dederat cursum fortuna peregi? The idea is that to have
lived 1n the sull sense, to have felt the pleasure of life, for one day,
makes a man indep endent of the future; he has had something
which cannot now be taken from him.

47. diffinget, ‘’alter ; see on 1. 35. 39. For the sentiment cp.
Agathou in Ar. Eth. N. 6. 2 μόνου γὰρ αὐτοῦ καὶ θεὸς στερίσκεται Ι

48. vem't, perhaps best, ‘has brought'3 Virg. G. 1. 461 ‘quid

flies, but what it has brought abides for ever. Others ma’ke‘ vexit’
= ‘avexitf

50. ludum· , 2. 1. 3 ‘ludum Fortunae?

54. resigno. Festus vouches for the use of ‘resignare' as =
‘rescribere' ; and ‘ rescribere,’ as we see from Sat. 2. 3. 75 (cp. the
opp. ‘scribe,’ ibid. 69), had the sense of ‘to pay back,' ‘to cancel
a bond by payment. ’ Horace uses the same word again in Epp.
Ι. 7. 34 ‘Hac ego si compellor imagine, cuncta resigno’ but no
other Roman writer is quoted for this use of it, which has passed
into modern languages.

5.5 virtute me involvo. He has given up the external gifts of
Fo⁵r3tune so far he is ‘.’nudus (3. 16. 23), but she cannot rob him
