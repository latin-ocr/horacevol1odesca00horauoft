BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE XXIII, 14-—ODE XXIV

Though less strictly. grammatical, it gains in weight, and it makes
the rhetorical balance of the sentence better, if it is made part ot
the predicative clause. Bentley took ‘sumptuosa hostia’ as a
nominative, defending the a either as lengthened by the following
‘bl,' or as the parallel of ‘ si non periret immiserabilis,' 3. 5. 17,
q. v. ‘A costly victim does not soothe the displeasure of the Penates
more winningly than,’ &c.

19. mollivit, not an aoristic, but a regular perfect, as is shown
by the conditional clause to which it answers : ‘ if the offering has
been made, the gods are satisfied.' Several of the best MSS. have
‘mollibit ’ [and it is so quoted by Servius]‚ but the perfect is sup-
ported by Stat. Silv. 1. 3. 130 ‘ deis . . . Caespes et exiguo placuerunt
farra salino‚’ Tibull. 4. 1. 14 ‘Parvaque caelestis placavit mica'
(both quoted by Keller), which seem like imitations; and we may
follow Bentley in refusing to admit what would be a solitary instance
in Horace of this form of the future in a doubtful reading, and
against the silence of the old grammarians, who are quick to notice
any such varieties.

20. A periphrasis for the ‘ mola salsa‚’ ‘ fruges salsae‚' Virg. Aen.
2. 133. The commentators say, but scarcely prove, that the
crackling of the salt in the fire was taken for a good omen. If so,
the two epithets will really characterize both substantives‚ and
mean, ‘duly offered and kindly received! The expression is
imitated Ov. F ast. 4. 409, Tibull. 3. 4. ιο.

ODE XXIV

‘ RICHES and luxurious abodes can stay neither care nor death.
The Scythians live more wisely, with no settled homes, no stores
of wealth. They have not the vices of civilized life. Their women
do not poison their step-children, nor rule their husbands, nor
break their marriage vows. Who would be known as the saviour
and father of his country? Let him check the licence of the time.
He may be hated by his contemporaries, but he will be glorious to
all ages, It is no good to complain :—punish the offenders z—no
good to make laws, while our lives give the lie to them, while
we scour sea and land for the sake of money, and think poverty
the one shame. Let us get quit of our wealth: root out the
evil if we are really tired of it, and train our sons in a manlier
school. Let them hunt instead of playing with the Greek hoop
and the dice, while their fathers are cheating to heap up money for
them, their unworthy heirs. That is the way wealth grows 3 and it
is an endless business, for it never can keep pace with desire.’

The Ode travels over the same ground as much of Odes 1, 2, 3
and 6 of this Book. We may note also how many of its expressions
