ODES, BOOK IV

ι, rapture of that happy day, even he too may find a voice and sing
2 his best, and shout with the shouting people, and make his humble
’ζ offerings. And yet—the tone changes in Ode 3-he remembers
⁴ that he is a poet, set apart from his birth by the Muse from

common ambitions and glories, recognized as such by the voice of
Rome 3 and 5ο, though all the glory is the Muse'S, not his own, he

3. The middle of the· Book is occupied with the expansion of
the same theme as that of Ode 3, the only theme besides the

triumphs and blessings of the Empire which seems to wake him

to any of his old lyric fire, the consciousness of his own poetic

. power, and the immortality which he can confer on others as he
’ has secured it for himself ¹. Odes 6, 8, 9, like Ode 3, while they

express Horace’s inmost feelings, lead also directly to the main

ἢ conspicuous for his private friendship for Maecenas. Two more
Odes in his old character as a poet of wine and of love, the second
., manifestly a companion and sequel to an Ode of Book iii, complete
{what he thinks necessary to give the relies of variety, and he
returns to Tiberius’ victory and the domestic peace of the reign of
Augustus

to this metaphorical ‘immortality,' the only immortality apparently in
which he believed. Cp. Od. 2. 20, 3. 30. 6 soll. and see on 3. 2. 21.
