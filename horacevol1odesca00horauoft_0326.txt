THE ODES OF HORACE

looks as if it had been written for such a purpose, as Od. 3. 30,
Epp. 1. 20. Its feeling seems really to lie in vv. 4-8.
He has not risen to feel his humble origin itself a distinction as

in 3. 30.

1. non usitata,‘ quia primus Romanae fidicen lyrae? Orelli.

2. biformis, a poet and yet a swan.

liquidum,‘ clear‚’ opposed to the damp and heavy atmosphere
of earth. Cp. ‘udam spernit humum? 3. 2. 24.

4. invidiaque maior, above the range of envy. For the use of
‘ que’ after a negative clause see on 1. 27. 16, 2. 12. 9.

5. urbis = the haunts of men.

pauperum sanguis parentum, the very words of the ‘invidi,' as
Sat. 1. 6. 46 ‘Nunc ad me redeo libertino patre natum, Quem
rodunt omnes libertino patre natum.’ ‘ Sanguis‚' as ‘regius sanguis ’
3. 27. 65 ; ‘sanguis deorum‚’ 4. 2. 13.

6. quem vocas. In the interpretation adopted of the Ode these
words refer to the solemn calling on the dead, ‘ voce vocare‚’ Virg.
Aen. 3. 68, 6. 506, &c. This alone gives a substantial meaning to
‘ vocas ’ used absolutely. The attempts to make it == ‘ ad te vocas,'
‘you invite,' as used of the living, always end in bathOS. The
alternatives are (1) to take it with ‘dilecte,’ separating that from
‘ Maecenas,' ‘whom thou callest “dear friend.”' To the' name
given him by the envious crowd, he opposes that given him by the
one whose judgement he most values. This is the interpretation of
the Scholiast, and of recent editors it has Munro’s support. Cp.
Maecenas’ expression of affection for Horace in the epigram pre-
served in the Suetonian life of the poet: ‘Ni te visceribus meis
Horati Plus 1am diligo, &c. It must be confessed that the separa-
tion of ‘ dilecte' from‘ M’aecenas is harsh3 and that such passages
as Ov. Am. 1. 7. 19 ‘Quis mihi non “demens‚’' quis non mihi

‘’'b‘arbare dixit?' do not reach the boldness of th’e vocative in this
place. (2) to adopt Bentley’s conj. ‘quern vocant’ — ‘as they call
me,’ the ‘non ego' being repeated with something of the defiant
tone of Sat. 1. 6. 46.

8. cohibebor, 2. 14. 9.

9. ‘The skin roughens and shrinks to my legS, as they also
shrink into the legs of a bird’3 ‘pelles,’ proleptically‚ as it is the
word for the skin of the swan, not of the human subject· see on
Epo6d. 167. 22. Notice the antithetical ‘asperaeu .’leves : see on

Ξ 1 superne. The e is short, as in Lucr. 6. 543 and 596: see
Wagner’s Plaut. Aulul. Introd. p. xxiii.

13. notior, the reading with the greatest MS. support, including ⁷-

that of B. The alternative 1s‘0cior.’ The hiatus in that case, if it

is to be defended, must be defended by the same considerations as

‘ periret’ in 3. 5. 17, viz. that the caesura separates two parts of an

asynartete verse. Bentley proposed ‘tutior’ (and he is followed

by Lachmann and by Kiessling), not to avoid the hiatus, but on the
