31. sublimi. Sometimes explained as a rendering of πνεῦμ’ ἅνω
ἔχειν Menandr. Hal. 3, the μετέωρον πνεῦμα of Hippocrates, of

ἠοᾶἳθῒέιῗξέξὲτθὺ, ‘ shall postpone the day of doom.’

ODE XVI

‘ FAIR daughter of a mother fair, though not so fair as you, burn
and forget my scurrilous iambics. Passion is as resistless as the
afflatus of Cybele, or Apollo, or Bacchus ; its expression as noisy and

senseless as the cymbals of the Corybantes. We are all liable to it, .

we all have our share of the lion’s heart. You may read its effects
in all story. Curb your passion ; Ι too was led astray by it. For-
give me, accept my palinode and be my friend.'

‘ Tyndaridi satisfacit . . . Imitatus est Stesichorum poetam Siculum
qui vituperationem Helenae scribens caecatus est et postea responso
Apollinis laudem eius scripsit et oculorum aspectum recepit, cuius
rei et in Epodo poeta idem meminit :—

‘ Infamis Helenae Castor offensus vice
Fraterque magni Castoris victi prece
Adempta vati reddidere lumina.’ Acron.

‘Hac ode παλινῳδίαν repromittit ei in quam probrosum carmen ·

scripserat Tyndaridi amicae suae! Porph.

ln accordance with this the Ode is headed in B and other MSS.
‘ad Tyndariden?

‘ Cantat palinodiam, i. e. cantando revocat quae scripserat iratus
in amicam Gratidiam,’ Comm. Cruq. And so some MSS. head it
‘ Palinodia Gratidiae.’ Others unite the two views, and identify
:rTyrcildariis ’ ‚with ‘ Gratidia ’ or ‘ Canidia ’; ‘ Palinodia Gratidiae vel

yn ari is.
