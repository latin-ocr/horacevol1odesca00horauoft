THE ODES OF HORACE

42. publicum ludum. The technical and usual phrase would ξ

g

be ‘ ludos,' but Horace varies it slightly, after his eustom3 2. 4. 24, ζ

3. 5. 42, 4. 14. 1, 4. 15. 9.

super impetrato . . . reditu, in discharge of the vows for his
return, which have won their purpose. Orelli mentions the fact
that coins have been found of the year Β. c. 16 (A. U. c. 738) with
the inscription S.P.Q.R.V.S. (vota suscepta) PRO S. (salute) ΕΤ
RED. AUG. The ‘ludi votivi ² here anticipated were really celebrated
in B.c. 133 Dion 54. 27.

45. audiendum, ‘that merits hearing.’ Horace is speaking, at
the moment, not of shouting with the shouting m0b‚ but of singing,
i. e. writing poetry3 but there is probably a metaphorical play in
the expression, ‘ if I can make my voice heard in the din.²

48. felix, ‘in my delight!

49 foll. The difficulties of this stanza are well known, and per-
haps no solution of them is thoroughly satisfactory. The reading
of the text is due to Pauly. The majority of the MSS. offer ‘ teque.’
‘ Tuque’ is found in some MSS. of secondary value, and adopted by
Ritter : ‘ procedit’ is found in the Berne MS.‚ having been proposed,
in ignorance of that fact, by Heinsius, and supported by Bentley.

ι If the pronoun be retained, two explanations seem possible :—

(1) That of the Scholiasts, ⁴ ad ipsum triumphum conversus haec
dicit': ‘Thy name will we pronounce as thy procession passes,
Ho Triumph! again and again, Ho Triumph ἰ ’ For ‘io Triumphe,’

as the cry raised as the procession passed along, cp. inter al. Ov. ,
Trist. 4. 2. 51 ‘Tempora Phoebea lauro cingentur, loque, Miles, Io, ⁴

magna voce, Triumphe, canent.’ That it was held to involve a
personification of Triumphus, appears from Livy’s expression 45.
38 ‘[Milites] triumphum nornine cient, suasque et imperatoris
laudem canentes per urbem incedunt.' But compare especially
Hor. Epod. 9. 21 foll. ‘Io Triumphe, tu moraris aureos Currus et
intactas boves? Io Triumphe, nec Iugurthino parem Bello re-
portasti ducem,' &c. 3 see note there. The objection to this is the

reference of ‘te‚’ in the same emphatic place in two consecutive ,

stanzas to two different subjects. It would be a blot in any writing,
and it interferes with the antithesis between Antonius and Horace
which gives their framework to these stanzas.

(2) We may refer ‘ teque ' to AntoniuS. (a) Those who feel this
to be the only possible answer generally accept the slightly sup-

ported ‘ tu? ‘ Procedis’ is then interpreted either (as by Ritter and .

Keller) of Antonius taking part in the triumphal procession as

‘ praetor ' in the year 13, or more generally (as Schiitz, Nauck) after ³.

‘prodeat' in the similar passage 3. 14. 6, of taking a prominent

place. (b) If ‘te’ is retained, the only way (and it seems not j

impossible) is to suppose that it anticipates the ‘ te’ of the next

stanza, the intervening words being parenthetical, a picture sug· s
