ODE XII

‘WINTER is past, and Spring reigns again. The ice is gone,
the swallow builds‚ shepherds sing their songs in the open air.
Come, then, Vergilius, and inaugurate the thirsty season with
a cask of the best wine I can get you. But you shall not come
empty· -handed, you bring the ointment if Ι find the wine. Above

all, cto,me with a mind void of care, and prepared for free enjoy-
men .

The chief interest of the Ode centres in the question to whom it
was addressed. Is it a playful letter actually sent by Horace on
some occasion to the great poet, and published six years after his
death, not so much for its intrinsic merits as for its reminiscences
of their friendship? On this theory (and it was held by Bentley),
we may expect there to be allusions in it which are now unintel-
ligible, though they would probably be well understood by Maecenas
and the many survivors of the literary circle in which Virgil and
Horace met. Doring, who takes this view, points out that the
images of the first three stanzas have a special appropriateness
as addressed to a poet, and the poet of the Bucolics and Georgics.
The chief difficulties in the way of the theory, apart from the
absence of any tradition on the subject (for the Scholiasts all
imagine some other Vergilius to be intended), lie in expressions
of v. 15 ‘iuvenum nobilium cliens,' and-v. 25 ‘studium lucri! Of
course these can be disposed of as covering meanings to which
we have lost the key 3 but it is rather hard to imagine any possible
meanings. ‘ Pone moras et studium lucri,’ is exactly the style in
which Horace would address one of his ordinary friends engaged
in the common pursuits of the day; but what can it mean addressed
to Virgil? We cannot really refer it to the proposed exchange of
wine for nard, and take it to mean, ‘Don’t haggle about the
bargain! ‘Iuvenum nobilium cliens,’ again, is natural enough and
complimentary enough, when some special ‘iuvenes nobiles,’ as
Drusus and Tiberius, are in Horace’s poetical favour, when the
fact of the dependency is notorious, and the point is the nobility,
in the best sense, of the patrons; but at what period of Virgil' s life
could it have sounded like a compliment? Macleane is content
with the Scholiast' 5 suggestion that Augustus and Maecenas are
the‘ iuv enes' ; but he can scarcely have really thought that the
possibility of such an expression was proved by Horace's calling
