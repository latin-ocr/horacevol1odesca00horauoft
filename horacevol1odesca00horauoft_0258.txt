THE ODES OF HORACE

wealth in corn-lands or cattle, not gold and ivory, not vineyards in ἕ
Campania. He envies neither those who grow the rich wines nor ?²'

the trader who at the eost of so much risk buys and drinks them. ς

Conterit with humble sare, all he asks is the power to enjoy health ζ
of body and of mind too now, and an old age not wanting either in ·
honour or in the pleasure of poetry.’

1. dedicatum. The Latins said ‘dedicare deum’ as well as
‘dedicare aedem,’ perhaps from the image of the god which was
installed in his shrine. Liv. 5. 51 ‘Iunonem dedicare.’

1.1.Ῑ>1..νε,1;ε>ει. The poet has a special claim on Apollo, the inspirer
ο is art.

novum. Wine of the latest making was proper for sacrifice (see
on 1. 19. 15). In this case there is felt to be a special appropriate-
ness in the wine of the new vintage to the new temple.

4. Sardiniae. Val. Max. 7. 6. 1 calls Sardinia and Sicily
‘benignissimas urbis nostrae nutrices.'

segetes, corn-land3 as often Epp. 2. 2. 161 ‘Qui segetes occat
tibi mox frumenta daturas.' He is speaking of ‘latifundia' in the
corn-growing provinces, see on Od. 1. 1. 9.

5. aestuosae Calabriae, cp. on the same topic Epod. 1. 25 f.
‘Non ut iuvencis illigata pluribus Aratra nitantur mea, Pecusve
Calabris ante sidus fervidum Lucana mutet pascuis.’ A second
investment of Roman wealth, large cattle farms; cp. Od. 2. 16. 33
‘ Te greges centum Siculaeque circum Mugiunt vaccae‚’ &c. ; Epp. ⁷
2. 2. 177 ‘Quid vici prosunt aut horrea? quidve Calabris Saltibus
adiecti Lucani ?’

grata, ‘ pleasant,’ to own or to see.

6. A villa adorned with gold and ivory; cp. Od. 2. 18. 1 ‘ Non
ebur neque aureum Mea renidet in domo lacuna1·.'

7. rura, i.e. as the next stanza shows, the wine-growing lands
through which the Liris (now the Garigliano) flow5. On the left
bank of the Liris, as it nears the sea, is the Ager Falernus, and at
a short distance the Mons Massicus.

8. mordet, Lucret. 5. 257 ‘ripas radentia flumina rodunt.’

9. ‘ Let who may own rich vineyards at Cales, I grudge them not.’

premant= ‘ reprimant‚’ check the luxuriant growth ; Virg. G. 1.
156 ‘ ruris opaci Falce premes umbram.' The words are probably
meant to imply the richness of the soil ancl luxuriance of the vines.
ggles was a town in the north of Campania. Its wine is named in

. 1. 20. . 12. 1 .

Calena {asise (cp.4 3. 6. 38) involves a slight hypallage, i. e. the
adjective would more naturally go with ‘ vitem.' ‘At Cales ’ is the
simple meaning. Bentley, objecting that though ‘prelo Caleno' ’
(1. 20. 9) would be natural ‘falce C.’ was less so, would read
‘ Calenam ’ without MS. authority, and is followed by some editors.
But it may be questioned whether this does not make ‘falce’ an
unnecessary detail. Its adjective is what gives it relevance.

10. et. Some good MSS. (including B) have ‘ut,’ which also
