BOOK IV, ODE Ι, 22-ODE ΙΙ, 8

was spared when his brother Marcus Antyllus was slain, and rose
eventually to high favour with Augustus, and was married to
Marcella, Octavia's daughter, after her divorce from Agrippa in
B.c. 21. Horace’s Ode is the only ancient authority for his having
been a poet ; but.the Pseudo-Acron vouches for his having written
an excellent Epic poem in twelve Books, called the Diomedeia‚
some years afterwards. He was made praetor in Β. c. 13, ancl
consul in B.c. 10. In 13.c. 2 he was condemned to death on the
charge of adulterous intercourse with Julia.

On the bearing of the Ode in its place see Introd. to Book iv.
The exact date of composition is less certain. It may have been
written in the year of Augustus’ return (Β. C. 13) or in anticipation
of it at any time after the submission of the Sygambri. Franke
thinks that the omission of reference to the successes of Tiberius
and Drusus makes it improbable that it was written after the year
15 ; others see in v. 49 (see note) a reference to the Praetorship of
Antonius, i.e. to B.c. 13.

2. Iule. The use of the praenomen was a mark of familiarity
(Sat. 2. 5. 32) which Horace would be likely to avoid. In this·
case, however, it would be felt as a compliment, as the name (not
properly a ‘ praenomen,’ but family names were used as praenomina
at this date; cp. ‘ Paulus’ in the last Ode) had been given him
(possibly by Octavia) to mark the connexion of his family with the
Julian house, through his grandmother Julia, the mother of Marc
Antony. In v. 26 we have the gentile name alone.

ope Daedalea, with ‘ ceratis,’ or perhaps with the whole ‘ ceratis
nititur pennis‚’ ‘ he has got some Daedalus to help him.' Probably,
as Ritter thinks, there is in the expression the idea of the audacity
of the enterprise (‘ Expertus vacuum Daedalus aera Pennis non
homini datis ' 1. 3. 34), as well as its danger.

3. nititur; Virg. Aen. 4. 252 ‘paribus nitens Cyllenius alis.’

4. nomina, for plural cp. 3. 27. 76. Compare with the stanza
the way in which Horace speaks of the enterprise when it is
undertaken by a friend, not offered to himself, Epp. 1. 3. 10
[Titius] ‘ Pindarici fontis qui non expalluit haustus, Fastidire lacus
et rivos ausus apertos?

7, 8. ‘ Boils and rushes in a flood of deep-mouthed utterance.’
As so often in Horace, the interpretation of the simile is clothed
still in language almost wholly metaphorical and borrowed from the
simile itself, see on Od. 1. 35. 19, 2. 2. 1, 4. 4. 59. ‘ Ore ’ belongs
more to the poet than to the river, ‘ profundo ore ’ being the ana-
logue of ‘ ore rotundo‚’ A. P. 323, ‘ magno ore,’ Virg. G. 3. 294, of
varieties of poetical style. The epithet, on the contrary, belongs
primarily to the river, and even ‘ ore ’ is a word which was probably

felt to be capable of an interpretation in the same connexion, though
