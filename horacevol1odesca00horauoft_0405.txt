aster year to grow mellow‚ is paired with ‘ tibi’ : it was kept sor you,
and is good enough sor you.

balanus=‘myrobalanus,' Plin. N. H. 12. 46, the Arabian ‘behen
nut,’ giving a fragrant oil.

5. iamdudum, antithetical to ‘ morae,' as ‘ me' to ‘ te.' My part
is done long ago; the delay is on your side.

6. neo. The good MSS. are divided between ‘nec’ and ‘ne.'
B has ‘ nec! 1f we choose ‘ ne’ it is final, ‘ that you be not for ever
looking.'> ‘ Nec’ is quite Horatian; cp. 1. 9. 15 ‘nec sperne‚’
1. II. 2 ‘nec temptaris,' 2. 11. 4 ‘nec trepides.’ Munro quotes for
the change from the imperative to the subjunctive of advice or
entreaty, both with negative and positive conJunctions, Martial
1. 70. 13 ‘Hanc pete, nec (ne) metuas,' 1. 117. 13 ‘Illinc me pete,
nec roges'; Tibull. 4. 4. 9 ‘Sancte veni, tecumque feras‚’ ‘pray‚
bring.’ The places named are all such as we view from Rome.
Missing this obvious sense, Lachmann altered ‘nec’ to ‘ hic,’ and
others have suggested ‘ ut ' ; but did they suppose that Horace had
residences at all these places, or that they were visible from his
farm in the Sabine hills, or that he was inviting Maecenas to a tour
about Latium?

Aefulae, evidently on the slopes of the hills near Tibur 3 its exact
position is not known. It has been identified with Monte Affliano,
two miles S. E. of Tivoli. Livy (26. 9) names the ‘arx Aefulae ’ as
one of the strongholds garrisoned on the approach of Hannibal;
and Pliny (3. 9) mentions it as one of the cities of Latium which
had ceased to exist before his time. There is a doubt as to the
form between Aefula and Aesula.

8. Telegoni iuga3 Epod. 1. 29 ‘Tusculi Circaea . . . moenia.'
Legends assigned its foundation to Telegonus, the son of Ulysses
by Circe, who unwittingly slew his father. Arist. Poet. 14.

9. fastidiosam, active, of that which causes ‘fastidium '; ‘ which
tires.’

10. molem3 cp. 2. 15. 1 ‘regiae moles.’ Perhaps the ‘domus
alta ’ (Epod. 9. 3) of Maecenas on the Esquiline. Conington, quoting
as parallel Virg. Aen. 1. 421 ‘Miratur molem Aeneas, magalia
quondam, Miratur portas strepitumque et strata viarum‚' prefers
to take ‘ molem ’ of the buildings of Rome generally.

11. beatae, ὀλβίας; cp. 1. 4. 14. Osten used, as here, for a
happiness vouched for by public opinion, rather than by the speaker.
Cp. Sat. 2. 8. I ‘ Ut Nasidieni iuvit te cena beati ? ’

12. fumum et opes strepitumque, the elements which, Horace
would say, make up that ‘happiness’ of Rome which as a whole
Maecenas is supposed to admire. The point is the mixture of
magnificence and annoyance; but Horace, as he indicates by the
collocation, would count the magnificence among the annoyanceS.
For ‘strepitum’ cp. Epp. 2. 2. 72 foll.

13. vices, a change of life.

14. mundae, ‘ neatly served’-—-see on Od. 1. 5. 5, Sat. 2. 2. 65,

Epp. 1. 4. 11.
