THE ODES OF HORACE

1. Descende caelo, for the Muses were Ὀλυμπιάδες, Hom. Il.
2. 491: not, as the Scholiast thought, with reference to the last
Ode and the ‘ sermones deorum.’

dic . . . melos, see on 1. 32. 3.

1-4. tibia . . . seu voce acuta . . . seu fidibus. The construction
is not quite perfect. There are not three choices offered, as might
appear, the pipe, or the voice, or the stringed instruments, but (as
Ritter points out) two. The voice will be used in any case3 the
alternative is between two tones of the voice and two several
accompaniments which suit them. Horace asks first that the
melody shall be on the pipe; he corrects ¹this, and laying the
emphasis on ‘longum,’ leaves it to Calliope (so long as in this
respect it is such as he asks for) to decide whether it shall be
‘voce acuta' (and so accompanied by the pipe) or ‘voce gravi’
(and so accompanied by the stringed instrument). There is the
same choice given to Clio (Ι. 12. 1), ‘lyra vel acri (cp. ‘acuta voce ’)
Tibia’; and the two kinds of accompaniment for lyric poetry are
common in Horace, as in Od. 1. 1. 32, where they are assigned
respectively to Polyhymnia and Euterpe. Cp. also 4. 1. 22.

2. longum, ‘ sustained.’ He is preparing for a longer effort than
usua13 ‘ maius opus movet.’

Calliope, see on 1. 1. 32, she is called ‘regina’ as a goddess, as
ἄνασσα, πότνια in Greek. The repetition of the vocative, and the
separation which gives greater emphasis to each utterance of it,
are intended to mark the earnestness of his appeal.

4. fidibus citharave. If, with the great majority of the MSS„
we retain ‘ ve,’ we must take ‘ fidibus ’ of the lyra. Such expressions ’
as λύρῃ κιθαρίζειν (Hom. Hymn. ad Merc. 423), show that in early
times the two names belonged to the same instrument, but they
were subsequently distinguished. The ‘cithara‚’ whose invention
was ascribed to Apollo, was like a modern guitar, its strings
stretched over the sounding body3 the ‘lyra,’ which remained the
property of Hermes (Epod. 13. 9 ‘fide Cyllenea ’), had its strings
open on both sides like a harp. Bentley, and most subsequent
editors, have preferred the less supported reading ‘que.’ In that
case ‘fidibus citharaque’ will bea‘fidibus citharae’: cp. Virg.
Aen. 6. 120 ‘ Threicia cithara fidibusque canoris?

5. ‘Is it a real sound that others too can hear, or am I the
subject of a “ fine frenzy’' ?'

amabilis insania, an oxymoron3 madness, but one of -which
I should not wish to be cured. Horace claims the ἐνθουσιασμός,
μανία (Plat. Phaedr. p. 245 A) of a poet.

6. pios lucos, not, as Acron interpreted it, of Elysium, but οἱ

the woods which the Muses haunt: Μουσῶν νάπαι, 'Plat. Ion, 2.
