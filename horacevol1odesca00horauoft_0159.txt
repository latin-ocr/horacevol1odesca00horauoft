These fragments have been pieced together, and are now to be seen

According to this inscription the games of Β. c. 17 took place on
the lst of June and two following days. The sacrifices described in
-it as offered by the Emperor and by Agrippa, who is associated
with him throughout, are-—

Ι. On three successive mJgkts, ‘ in campo ad Tiberim‚'

1. -To the Moerae‚ an offering of ewe-lambs and goats.

2. To the Ilithyiae, an offering ofcakes (⁴popana,’ cp. Juv. 6. 541,
‘ liba,’ ‘ phthoides ’).

3. To Terra mater.

11. On three successive days,

1. On the Capitoline to ‘ Iuppiter optimus maximus,’ an offering

of two ‘boves mares!
2. Also on the Capitoline to Juno, two ‘ boves feminae!
3. On the Palatine to Apollo and Diana, an offering of cakes,
as in the case of the Ilithyiae.
On the last day it is added, ‘sacrificioque perfecto pueri XXVII
quibus denuntiatum erat patrimi et matrimi et puellae totidem carmen
cecinerunt eodemque modo in Capitolio carmen composuit Q.
Horatius Flaccus.’ γ
· It will be noticed that the list of sacrifices omits those to Dis

and Proserpina, which are mentioned by Zosimus. In this it is in
accord with Horace’s Ode which knows nothing of those deities.
Dis and Proserpina were, according to Censorinus, the deities to
whom the original ‘ludi Tarentini ’ were dedicated, but Augustus,
though linking his ‘ ludi saeculares’ to these in respect of place
and much of the ceremonial, gave them a new turn, substituting in
the nightly sacrifices the inore beneficent for the darker of the
Chthonian Powers, the Moerae Ilithyiae and Demeter for Dis and
Proserpina, and adding the sacrifices by day to the greater deities,
the place of honour being given to Apollo and Diana.
