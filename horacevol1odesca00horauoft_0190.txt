THE ODES OF HORACE

' comes to speak of it, the ternis he uses are such as imply that it is .

better than any of them, its pleasure purer, its rewards higher.
Metre—First Α sclepiad.

1. See on 3. 29. 1 ‘Tyrrhena regum progenies.' If there is not
the full purpose in the address which there is in Sat. Ι. 6. 1, it is
not an irrelevant compliment; in connexion with the next line it
has the force of ‘ so far above uS, yet whose power is my protection,
and whose glory is my pride! The Cilnii, Maecenas' ancestors on
his father’s side, are named (Liv. 10. 3) as a powerful family at
Arretium in the fourth century B. c.

atavis, ‘ancestorS,’ cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 56 ‘ Turnus avis atavisque
potens.’ When contrasted with other compounds of ‘avus‚' ‘atavus'

Ξέπίπαππος, the fifth ancestor: ‘pater‚ avuS, proavus, abavus, .

atavus,' Plaut. Pers. 1. 2. 6.

edite, Virg. Aen. 8. 137 ‘ Electram maximus Atlas Edidit.’

2. Cp. Od. 2. 17. 4 ‘ mearum Grande decus columenque rerum’3
Ep. 1. 1. 103 ‘rerum tutela mearum'3 Virg. G. 2. 40 ‘O decus,
O famae merito pars maxima nostrae.’ N otice that here, as with

the corresponding word in the other passages, ‘'meum is in the ·

emphatic place,‘ to ine-⁹
3. sunt. quos. ‚iuvan ‘ Sunt qui’ may take either a Sub-
junctlve, in which case‘ qui ’has its consecutive force· ‘sunt qui

dicant,’ ‘ there are people to say' : or an Indzmcatzve, ln which case ι

‘ sunt-qui,' like “ nescio quis,’ becomes a new pronoun, the subject
of a definite categorical statement. The former is the more Latin
construction, more consonant with the usages of the Relative‚ and
is preferred in prose, although the Indicative is also found, as in
Sall. Cat. 19. 4, where see Kritz’ s note. Horace, swayed perhaps
by his love of Greek constructions, prefers the Indicative, after the
model of εισὶν οἵ. Cp. Od. 1. 7. 5, Sat. 1. 4. 24. But he uses the
Subjunctive a150, Sat. 1. 2. 28, 1. 4. 74, Epp.1.1.77.1n some
cases the text is doubtful, as in Sat. 2. 1. 1. In Epp.2.2. 183
‘ Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere,' he seems to use
the two constructions as a means of contrasting the vagueness of
a general statement with the definiteness of a known particular
instance. ‘ There are who have not: I know one who cares not to
have.’

curriculo may mean either the‘ course,’ as in Cic. Mur. 27. 57

‘quadrigarum ‚curriculum,’ or the‘ chariot‚' as in Ov. Trist. 4. 8
‘curriculo gravis est facta ruina meo!

4. collegisse. On comparison with Sat. 1. 4. 31 ‘pulvis collectus
turbine,' perhaps rather‘ to have raised a cloud of dust' than ‘to
have become dusty.' For the Perf. see on 3. 4. 52.

fervidis, Virg.G.3. 167 ‘volat vi fervidus axis ;’ the object was
to round the‘ metae’ as closely as possible, and with the chariot
going at full speed.

5. palma nobilis, ‘the palm of glory‚’ Paus. 8. 48⁸ ες δέ τὴν δεξιάν
ἐστι καὶ πανταχοῦ τῷ νικῶντι ἐστιθέμενος φοῖνιξ.
