is as short-lived as that of the ‘fenerator Alfius' in Epod. 2. Cp.
Od. 2. 16. 1-4, where the point is the same, ‘ Otium Divos rogat in

tells us was the school of the ancient Roman heroism, Od. 1. 12. 44

20. solido de die. He is speaking probably not of letting the

’ζ festivities of the evening encroach on the day's work (‘ tempestivum

convivium‚' Cic. Mur. 6. 13, &c.), but of breaking the continuity of

, business hours. Compare for the metaphor‚ Varr. R. R. 1. 2

‘diffindere insititio somno meridiem‚’ and Horace himself, Od. 2. 7.

thinking of this place when he wrote, Ep. 83 ‘hodiernus dies

sacrae. All springs were sacred. Cp. Od. 3. 13. The epithet
adds to the feeling of the happy influences of the spot.

23. lituo tubae, ‘ stridOr lituum clangorque tubarum,' Luc. 1. 237.
The‘ lituus ' was a curved horn emitting a shrill note, used by the

cavalry—the ‘ tuba' was straight, and belonged to infantry.

atus Hannibal.² Cicero uses ‘ detestatus' as a passive, De Legg.

deer had been sighted, if the boar was still safe in the netted enclo-

tereti fune factus,’ Schol. It seems doubtful whether it would give
the idea of ‘ closely twisted' and so ‘ strong ' (cp. ‘ teretes catenae,'

29. doctarum, i. e. a poet’s. The epithet is derived from the
σοφὸς ἀοιδός of heroic times, ὃν Μοῦσ’ ἐδίδαξε (Hom. Od. 8. 481),
the Muse‚ the daughter of Memory. The poet learnt and remem-
