BOOK IV, ODE XIII, 2——ODE XIV, 2 '

‘notus animi paterni ’ in 2. 2. 6, and he has been followed by many
editors. In this case ‘et’ must be taken as = ‘etiam.’ But if ‘que
et’ in this sense is allowable, the emphasis so given is hard to
justify, and the sentence is clumsy. It is better to take it in the
simpler sense to which the rhythm leads us, ‘felix, notaque, et
artium gratarum facies? ⁴ Nota' will then mean (as Schiitz) that
her beauty was recognized, she was a general ‘toast‚’ ‘publica
cura‚' Od. 2. 8. 8. With ‘artium facies’ cp. ‘centum puer artium’
4. 1. 15. In speaking of ‘ winsome wiles‚’ his mind is perhaps going
back to the wiles, which now are not winsome, of one who ‘vult
formosa videri! Both ‘felix’ and ‘nota’ agree with ‘quae‚' sc.
Lyce, ‘facies’ being substituted as the subject only in the last
clause. Cp. Epod. 5. 73 ‘Vare . . . O multa fleturum caput.’

24. parem, ‘to match the years’ of the crow; ‘annosa cornix‚’
3. 17. 13.

26. fervidi, their hearts still warm with youth and passion, to
heighten the contrast of the cold, burnt-out torch‚ that can no
longer kindle love.

28. dilapsam. This seems to have been the reading of Acron,
though the MS. authority is rather in favour of ‘delapsam'3 the
confusion is very common. As Bentley points out, the difference
of the image is between atorch burnt down to a heap of ugly ashes
(‘ consumpta in cinerem,' Aen), and of one ‘tumbled in the ashes’3—
what ashes it would not be quite clear.

ODE XIV

‘How can senate and people worthily honour thy virtues,
Augustus, and transmit their memory to all time? The triumphs
of the Nero brothers-of Drusus over the Vindelici, Genauni, and
Breuni, of Tiberius over the Raeti-are all owing to thy auspices.
How terrible was Tiberius in the pursuit3 as the south wind on
the waters, or as the river Aufidus when it pours in a torrent from the
hills down on the plain! Thine were the plan and provision of
the campaign, thine its divinely-ordered success, for the victory
came on a day already noteworthy for thy happy fortune—just
fifteen years aster the capture of Alexandria. Thy reign has been
a series of triumphs, and now all the world is at thy feet?
