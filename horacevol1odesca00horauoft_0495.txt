61, 62. Haupt condemns these verses, and others have altered
their place, putting them variously after vv. 50 52, and 56. But
‘contagiaf ‘secrevitss seem to give the connexion which makes
them appropriate here. Isolation protects their flocks and herds
from disease, as it protects men from moral contagion.

‘Aquilo impotens!

64. Compare Ov. Met. 1. 89— 127. Horace has cut down the
more usual four ages to three, omitting the ‘silver‚’ Virg. G. 1.
120 foll. only recognizes two stageS.

65. aere, for the repetition cp. above, v. 413 a few MSS. have

EPODE XVII

’ Heraea-1 yield, Canidia. 1 acknowledge your power; cease
your spells. Achilles took compassion on Telephus, and gave back
Hector's body to Priam's prayers. Circe restored Ulysses’ com-
