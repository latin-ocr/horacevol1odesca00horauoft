THE ODES OF HORACE

malignum spernere vulgus, either the same as Od. 3. 2. 23
‘[Virtus] Coetusque vulgaris et udam Spernit humum fugiente
penna’3 ‘malignum’ being==‘profanum’ in ·3. 1. 1, or more
likely referring to the envy which his fortune and his rising fame
brought with them, see on Od. 2. 20. 4-7.

ODE XVII

‘ KILL me not, Maecenas, with your dismal forebodings. If you
are going to die, I die too; so the gods will, and so I will. For
mys-clf, I could not survive the one half of myself: I have sworn,
and will be true to my oath of fealty; where you go 1 will go, if
the Chimaera or Gyas were to rise to prevent it. And the gods
will it too. I know not whether 1 was born under a good star
or a bad one, but my horoscope tallies wonderfully with yours.
You recovered from dangerous illness just when I escaped the
falling tree. Let us remember it, and in our several ways thank
the gods.'

Maecenas was an invalid (Plin. N. H. 7. 54 ‘ Quibusdam perp‘etua
febris est sicut C. Maecenati. Eidem triennio supremo nullo horae
momento contigit somnus ⁹), and one that clung passionately to
life, if we may trust his own lines preserved by Seneca, Epp.

‘ Debilem facito manu,
debilem pede, coxa,

tuber adstrue gibberum,
lubricos quate dentis;

vita dum superest, bene est,
hanc mihi vel acuta

si sedeam cruce, sustine.’

He has been complaining of his health to Horace, and the poet {f

would coax him out of his hypochondriacal fears by the expression

of affection, by the profession of his own strong belief that Mae: ·

cenas’ life is as⁴ good as his own, by recalling his previous recovery
from illness and his flattering reception in the theatre, as memories
likely to strengthen his confidence in his destiny and in himself.
The astrological part of the Ode is only an adaptation of the
language of a popular superstition which Horace condemns in
Od. 1. 11. Orelli points out that the language of stanza 5, ‘seu
Libra seu‚' &c., forbids the idea that Horace had confidence in any
calculation of his own horoscope. He tells uS, Sat. 1. 6. 114, that
he was fond os standing and listening to the astrologers of the
circus. With the poet’s professions of his resolution not to survive

Ἣ Α, ..,,

Maecenas cp. Epod. 1; on Maecenas' reception in the theatre, ν

Od. 1. 203 and on Horace’s own escape from the falling trec,

ocklssecegas actually died in Β. c. 8, a few months before Horace.
