THE ODES OF HORACE

central figure. By her side (‘hinc . . . hinc’) are ranged all the
other gods; but of the three named to represent them if one is
characterized by fiery zeal, the other two suggest queenly dignity
and poetic grace.

58. avidus, absol. asin Tac. Ann. 1. 51 ‘avidae legiones’ 3 more
usually with a genitive, as ‘avidus pugnae,’ Virg. Aen. 12. 430.

60. ‘Whom they could never hope to find unarmed and unpre-

pared for battle! The following stanza is intended to accumulate
images of Apollo, his grace of form and his pursuits‚ which contrast
, with the‘ uncouth and brutal Titans,² his haunts by streams and
woodland‚ the fount of the Muses, the long hair of youth and of the
bard (see on 4. 6. 26). We may note, also, in illustration of vv. 63,
64, that when Virgil would express Aeneas' beauty and grace of
movement, he compares him to Apollo leading the dance in Delos',
when he revisits it from Lycia (Aen. 4. 144).

61. lavit. For the form see on 2. 3. 18.

63. natalem silvam, Virg. l. c. ‘maternam Delon.’ For other
not8ices ofdApollo’s migration between Patara and Delos see Herod.

66. temperatam, ‘under control’, possibly, as Conington sug-
gests, with a reference to the use of‘ temperare vinum’ ‘,tempered’

s‘oftened, by the admixture of mind. Orelli points out how the
repetition of‘ vis,’ ‘vim,’ ‘viresss marks the application of the
preceding stanzas. -

69. testie mearum sententiarum. It is rather a rough and
prosaic turn for Horace; but he is probably trying to be Pindaric.
See on 4. 4. 18. On the variance of the MSS. between Gyas and
Gigas see on 2.17.14.

70. integrae, i. q. ‘intactae‚' τῆς ἀει παρθένου.
