USE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE

cases the adjective and the infinitive are essentia] to one another-
it is a mere accident of language that the ‘irascibility’ or the
‘power of lifting’ is not expressed in a single word—but in the
third case·the idea of each is complete: the infinitive adds an
illustration‚ almost a result, of the quality named by the adjective,
it is almostx‘ tam blandus ut ducat? .

On the second point we may notice the change in the relation oi

the infinitive (a) when the adjective to which it is appended is, =

negative in sense. This is clear in such cases as ‘indoctus ferre?
‘timidus perire? ‘piger ferre' ε it may cause some ambiguity when
the negative character of the adjective is less clear, or where it
would have been equally open to the poet to regard it from its
positive side, and to make the infinitive the complement of the:
whole, not merely of the positive part, viz. the attribute denied or
disparaged. Contrast, e.g., ‘ferre iugum pariter dolosi’ with
‘ cautum dignos assumere,' ‘callidum condere,’ &c.; (b) in 'such
cases as the last three given above, where the adjective and the
infinitive seem to have changed places, where it issno longer an
internal quality of the subject leading to some action, but an action
which is the cause or ground of the attribute, no longer ‘brave so
as to conquer,’ but ‘famous because he conquers! ’
‘Niveus videriss Od. 4. 2. 59, like ‘nefas videre,’ Ep od. 16. 14,
seems to be more purely an imitation of a Greek idiom (λευκὸς ’

ὁρᾶσθαι, ἀθέμιτον ἰδεῖν).
