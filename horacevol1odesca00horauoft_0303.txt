coast and Ita-ly3 see 3. 4. 28 ‘Sicula Palinurus unda.' The chief

on the north coast near Messina, and of L. Lutatius Catulus in 242
off the Aegates Insulae, at the western extremity of the island.

I contremuit, with accusative, as Virg. Aen. 3. 648‘ sonitumque

Α pedum vocemque tremisco? For the implied comparison of
Augustus and his enemies to Jupiter and the giants see Od. 3. 4.
So the‘ fulgens contremuit ² has point as expressing the greatness,

. magnificence‚ of the interests threatened.

9. tuque pedestribus. This gives a second reason why Horace

’ should not attempt the theme. It would not suit his‘ iocosa lyra,’

'tl and Maecenas will treat it better in prose. For ‘'que in such

ἦ which imply the double opposition between Horace and Maecenas,

call Terentia (if it be she)‘ my mistress’ because he calls Maecenas
(not‘dominusss but)‘ rexque paterque,' Epp. 1. 7. 32. For ‘domina‚’
