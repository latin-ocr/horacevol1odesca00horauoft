THE ODES OF HORACE

pulverem Olympicum ⁹), the same description of the poet's life

(v. 30 ‘me gelidum nemus,' &c.)‚ and of his hope to be ranked

with the Greek lyrists (cp. ‘ Lesboum . . . barbiton,' ‘lyricis vatibus

{indserisss with ‘inter amabilis vatum ponere me choros,’ ‘Romanae
icen lyrae ⁹).

peated. Cp. 1. 24. 16, C. S. 26.
2. nascentem . . . videris; HeS. Theog. 82 Ὄντινα τιμήσουσι

3. labor Isthmius, as in Pindar κάματος and πόνος. Statius 'V

imitates it in Silv. 4. 4. 31 ‘ Elei labores.’

4. clarabit, a rare and archaic word, not found elsewhere in this
sense of ‘ make famous!

5. ducet, not in the race, but rather (with ‘victorem ') in the
triumphal procession. The double picture is completed in Horace’s

Οῐὲἱὲὴξὶῐὲἓθῖὲ opposed to the Roman triumphal chariot described
in the following lines. Virgil and Horace (Od. 1. 15. 35) use the

word, like the Homeric Ἀχαιοί, generally of the Greeks before ·-
Troy; and this would nearly coincide with its prose meaning in ·

their time, as the province of Achaia included all southern Greece.

6. res bellica, opposed to ‘ res ludicra‚’ ‘ war and all that belongs ‘⁴

10. praefluunt = ‘ praeterfluunt' ; 4. 14. 25 ‘ Aufidus Qui regna
Dauni praefluit Apuli,' Liv. 1. 45 ‘infima valle praefluit Tiberis?
‘ Horace evidently means that the scenery of Tibur contributes to
the formation of lyric genius. It is Wordsworth's doctrine in the
germ3 though, if the author had been asked what it involved,
perhaps he would not have gone further than Ritter, who resolves
it all into the conduciveness of a pleasant retreat to successful
