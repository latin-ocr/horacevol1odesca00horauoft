ODES, BOOKS I-III

ξ 15. If we knew more of Horace’s relations to private friends or
public characters¹ to whom he addresses Odes, we should possibly
see in more cases than we do an appropriateness in the places
assigned to them. In a few cases it is evident. The position of
[Maecenas as the patron ‘ prima dictus summa dicendus Camena ’ is
marked, as I have already noticed, by the dedication to him of 1. 1
and 3. 29. It is marked also by scattering the other Odes
addressed to him at measured intervals as caresully as the political
· Odes. We are never to be long without hearing his name ². For
the contrasted position which he oecupies in B. iv, see introduction

v to that Book.

It is interesting to notice in the first three Odes of B. i, that the
name which stands next to Maecenas and Caesar is that of the
poet Virgil, the friend to whose introduction to Maecenas Horace
owed his fortunes. It has been pointed out as probably significant
that the next three Odes addressed to real persons (4, 6, 7) bear
the names of men with special claims to the emperor’s favour:
Sestius cos. suffect. in B.c. 23, Agrippa the victor of Actium, and
(though the identification is less certain) L. Munatius Plancus, on
whose proposal the title of Augustus had been bestowed by the
Senate in B.c. 27. Similarly Kiessling has pointed out that Pollio,
ὲ Sallustius, and Dellius, whose names stand at the head of
ἱ Odes 2, 1, 2, 3, are ranked together in Sen. de Clem. 1. 10, as
, amongst the first of the leading citizens to reconcile themselves
to Octavianus.

ξ 16. The arrangement of the Epodes prepares us to expect that
melre would have some influence in the placing of the Odes.
A negative influence it evidently has, from the care with which he
avoids the juxtaposition of two Odes of the same metre. In the
; great instance to the contrary (3. 1—6) the obvious purpose gives
’ the greater significance to his usual practice. As a positive motive
ε for placing particular Odes the principle has less scope, but we
cannot but notice that in B. i the first nine Odes furnish specimens
of nine out of the eleven metres found in the three Books‚ one of

¹ The case of unknown names, male and female, Pyrrha, Lydia, Sybaris,
and the like, stands on different grounds, and is dealt with in Appendix Ι.
