‘LmER EPODON,' ‘Liber Vt¹¹⁸ qui Epodon inscribitur,’ are the
11;ἰῖ1ε5 by which this Book is headed in MSS„ and cited by the
.‘1,g·rammatical and metrical writers of the fourth and fifth centuries,
.›Marius Victorinus, DiomedeS, FortunatianuS. The separate poems
ἔειπε called Odae. The word Epode (ἐπῳδός) was a recognized
mvietrical term for the shorter verse of a couplet, which is as it were
ζ the echo (ἐπᾴδεται, ‘ accinitur ⁹) of the longer one, and then συνεκδρ-
«xixan- for the metre or poem (more properly ‘ carmen epodicum ’) in
r *sffwhich such a sequence occurred ¹. Elegiae verses are thus admitted
³ βε Epodic by Victorinus (p. 2500), but in common use the term was
:·' appropriated to the couplet metres of Archilochus and their Horatian
imitations‚ It may be noticed that such metres are not peculiar to
..the so-called ‘Epodesss Two of the couplets known specially by
i ⁴ rchilochus' name occur only in the Odes (1. 4, and 4. 7), the latter
,’5 the one example of an ‘ Epodus ’ quoted from Horace by
erentianus Maurus.

Horace's own name sor these poenis is ‘lambi' (Epod. 14. 7,
,’.”1ᾰ 1. 16. 3 and 24, Epp. 1. 19. 25), a term which implied their
gjharacter at least as much as their mette (cp. the Greek verb
ξξιμβίζειν, and see Arist. Poet. c. 4, 5, cp. Hor. A. P. 79 ‘ Archilochum
- roprio rabies armavit iambo ').

§made to find other meanings for the term ‘Liber Epodon’ as applied to
‘cinomce’s poems. Scaliger (Poet. 1. 44), ignoring apparently the chrono-
,illogical difficulty, interpreted it to mean ‘after Odes.’ Torrentius made the
’ ¹⁴word a mse of ἐπῳδὴ, ‘liber incantationum‚’ a general name given to the
“Book from the character of two os its most important poemS‚ Epod. 5 and 17.
