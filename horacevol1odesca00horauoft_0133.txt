INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV ,

THERE is no reason to doubt the account given by Suetonius
J of the origin of this Book. The occasion and general date of it are
fixed clearly on its own evidence. With the exception of Ode 6,
which is manifestly written at the same time as the Carmen
{³ Saeculare, i. e. in B.C. 17, all the Odes that can be dated refer
ζ,> immediately to two events, viz. (1) the return of Augustus to Rome
'²- in B.C. ,ι 3, after three years’ absence in Gaul, whither he had gone
‚ in· the year 16, on the news of the defeat of Lollius by the
Sygambri; (2) the double campaign of Drusus and Tiberius in
Raetia and Vindelicia‚ which occupied the year 15.

,Α The general tone of the Book, as well as its particular references,
· suit the period thus assigned to it. Its opening bears witness to
³ the interval which separates it from Horace’s last essays in lyric
,f verse. Cp. Epp. 1. 1. 1-10 and 2. 1. 111. That interval has
,, brought marked changes in the poet’s fortunes, as well as in the
ζῇ, political world. The contrast of 4. 5 or 15 with 1. 12 or 3. 24,
-'„ is hardly more striking than that of 4. 3 with 1. 1. The sons of
³ Livia‘ have taken the place of Marcellus; the military triumphs,
’ and the moral and social reforms which in the earlier Books were

.'‘ prophecy, are now history3 the Cantabrian‚ ‘non ante domabilis‚’

 

is ‘no longer a cause of disquiet3 the Parthians have restored the
ζ standards of Carrhae, and Phraates and his quarrels are forgotten ;
J.- *the vague alarms about the Dacian, or projects of conquest in
Britain, have given place to real dangers met on the Rhine‚ and
j substantial victories won in the Eastern Alps. The position os one
ἰ, name in the Book marks more clearly still the contrast between
³5 the two epochs, both in respect of the outer world and of Horace’s
own life. Maecenas, whom even in B.C. 19 he addressed as ‘prima
dicte mihi, summa dicende Camena,’ is mentioned but oncefin this

 

,ᾖ Book. His birthday is the occasion of Ode 11, and he is spoken
5² of in terms of the old affection3 but (1) we‘ have no hint now of his
² beingstill inte-tested in politics, a change which tallies with· the

date assigned by Dion (54. 19) to his loss of the favour of Augustus
and to his retirement from public affairs in B.c. 163 and (2) he is
