THE ODES OF HORACE

from is where their fathers dwelt before them. ‘ Sordidos ’ makes
the case harder by noting their poverty.

29. ‘Yet no mansion more certainly awaits the wealthy master
. than that one traced out for him by the limit of Orcus greedy as
himself.’ ‘ Destinata’ agrees with an ablative 631113,’ understood.
Conington points out that the phraseology, ‘aula‚’ ‘destinata,’
‘ rapacis,’ is chosen so as to suggest 3 comparison between Death
and the ‘dives erus' himself (see on 3. 24. 5), ‘Meantime Death
more punctual than any contractor, more greedy than any encroach-
ing proprietor, has planned with his measuring-line a mansion of
a different kind, which will infallibly be ready when the day
arrives

30. Oroi fine. Ritter takes this as a local ablative = ‘in finibus
Orci‚’ quoting for the singular, Od. 1. 34. 11 ‘Atlanteus finis? It
is more probably instrumental, ‘by the limit of Orcus' being

equivalent to ‘by Orcus, who sets a limit to all things. ‘Mors v

ultima linea rerum,’ Epp. 1. 16. 79. There may be a remembrance
of the Gr. τέλος θανάτοιο. That it should interfere to some extent
with the personification would not, in interpreting Horace, be

a fatal objection (see on 1. 35. 21, 2. 16. 21), but perhaps the limit ο

which Death sets to life and its plans may be allowed to stand for
the measuring· rod with which he traces the place and bounds
of the mansion which he prepares for the living. ‘Destinare’ is
especially used of tracing out the site for a building. Bentley
quotes the Culex 391 ‘ Conformare locum capit impiger, hunc et in
orbem Destinat.’

Other ways of taking the lines are: (1) to make ‘destinata’

agree with ‘'fine in the sense of ‘than the end of Orcus already Q
traced for him’· (2) to take ‘destinata' as a nominative with J
‘aula,' n‘o house that he has planned awaits him more surely than 2
the end of Orcus’ 3 (3) with Bentley to understand‘ certior’ of

the comparative certainty of death to the rich and the poor. ⁷
‘ Nulla certior (h. e. non certior) aula manet divitem erum [quam ··
pauperem clientem] designata et descripta termino ipsius Orci ·
(h. e. aeque spatiosa ac ipse Orcus).' All these sacrifice a good
deal of the personification of Orcus, which seems to be implied 111
1113 remainder of the Ode, Bentley’s most of all, so much so that
he wishes to read‘ capacis? It 15 to be observed t'hat his interpreta-
tion really necessitates this change, and this necessity is fatal to it.
Death must, on his view, be represented as a boon, otherwise the

is enforced in the first clause by the opposition, ‘the pauper and
the prince’ 3 in the second by the accumulation of the qualities
that might be expected to make a difference,‘ no wit, no wealth'
in the third and fourth by the double contrast (which, has 3 direct
