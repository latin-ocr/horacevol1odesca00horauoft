Ο. C. 1697 ; so Od. 1. 27. 19 ‘ quanta laborabas Charybdi’3 so also
negatively A. Ρ. 19 ‘ sed non nunc erat his locus.' (2) ‘ It is as we
thought truly,’ as here. (3) ‘ So we thought, but experience shows
it is not so ’: this is the use in the passages of Ovid often quoted
to illustrate this place z Trist. 4. 8. 5 ‘ N unc erat ut posito deberem

‘ dudum oportebat '3 ὥρα δ’ ἦν πάλαι, Arist. Eccl. 877. This, how-
ever, weakens the antithesis, ‘ nunc . . . antehac.'

5. antehac, a disyllable, as ‘ anteit,' Od. 1. 35. 37.

Caecubum, 1. 20. 93 Epod. 9. 1 ‘ repostum Caecubum in festas

immobile saxum.² Cp. Od. 3. 3. 42, 3. 5. 12.

7. regina. The title ‘ regina ² would be doubly odious to Roman
ears, Cp. Od. 3. 5. 9 ‘ sub rege Medo,’ and Epod. 9. 12 ‘emanci-
patus feminae! Orelli notes that coins of Cleopatra's have been
found with the inscription ΒΑΣΙΛῑΣΣΑ ΚΛΕΟΠΑΤΡΑ, and coins of

9. ‘With’ her polluted crew of shamed creaturesl The ref. of
