{onds of his brother Aegyptus, and now bade them slay each her
r1 e room.

33.gsplendide mendax, an oxymoron already familiar to poetry
and poetical rhetoric. Aesch. Fr. 273 ἀπάτης δικαίας οὐκ ἀποστατεῖ,

Soph. Ant. 74 ὅσια πανουργήσασα, Eur. Bacch. 334 καταψεύδου καλῶς,
Cic. pro Mil. 27 ‘ mentiri gloriose.’

40. falle, *λάθῃ decipe fugiendo‚’ Schol. Cp. Epp. 1. 5. 31
‘postico salle clientem.’

41. ‘Like lionesses that have come on a herd of cal-ees, are
sending, ah me! each her own.’ She imagines what is even now
passing in each chamber. ‘ Lacerant’ continues the image of the
lionesses; the simile passes into a metaphor.

' 45—47. me, me, ‘I don't care for myself‚ if 1 can save you; my
father may load me with chains, if you go sree from the prison-
house.’ The antithesis is the same as in the epitaph quoted
on v. 1.

46. {lemene misero. For the relation of the adjectives see on
1. . 10.

29. pedes et aurae. The two are alternatives, for she means
‘fly either by land or sea,’ as it is put more fully in Epod. 16. 21
‘Ire pedes quocumque ferent, quocumque per undas Notus voca-
bit’ 3 so that this may be added to the many instances in which
the Latin (and Greek) poets put conjunctively, as possibilities
united in the fact of their being offered at the same time, what we
should put disjunctively as alternative possibilities which cannot be
realized at the same time. See on Od. 1. 3. 9, 3. 27. 5, Epod. 2.
13 ; compare Virg. G. 2. 25 ‘ Quadrifidasque sudes et acuto robore
vallos,’ which describes two alternative modes of treating the
‘stirpes ’ of the preceding verse3 and Virg. Aen. 2. 645 ‘misere-
bitur hostis exuviasque petet‚’ of the different motives, one or other
of which will induce some enemy to kill Anchises. ·

rapiunt has the inceptive force of the present, ‘are waiting to
snatch thee away!

· 51.,nostri= ‘mei‚' as 3. 27. 14 ‘Et memor nostri, Galatea,
vivas. ,

sepulcro, ‘on my tomb’; perhaps a cenotaph‚ as the ‘ Hectoreus
tumulus’ of Virg. Aen. 3. 304. Ovid (Her. 14. 127) understands it
of a request that he will actually bury her, and imagines the full
epitaph which he is to inscribe, ‘Exsul Hypermnestre, pretium
pietatis iniquum, Quam mortem fratri depulit ipsa tulit:

ODE XII

THIS Ode seems to be rightly taken as a soliloquy put into
the mouth of Neobule. ‘She is one of the unhappy maidens
who can neither give free play to their love, nor forget it over
the wine cup, without the dread of an uncle’s fierce tongue. She
