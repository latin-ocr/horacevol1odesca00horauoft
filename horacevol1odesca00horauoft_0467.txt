EPODE 11, 9-37

23. Some good MSS. begin a new Epode here, and Aer. supports
them, writing at v. 1 ‘Laus vitae rusticae,’ and here ‘Introducit
quendam feneratorem loquentem et laudantem vitam quietam nec
tamen suum propositum deserentem.’ See Introd. to Od. 1. 7.

24. tenaci seems to mean ‘soft and deep,' that makes a couch
from which you do not slip.

25. rivis, the reading of V and B against‘ ripiS, ’the reading of
a large number of MSS. ‘Altis’ rivis’ must apparently mean ‘in
brimming watercourses’ ‘altis ripis 'has been variously rendered;
Bentley, who prefers it on the ground that we are speaking of
summer or autumn when streams are low, interprets ‘with their
banks high,' i. e. ‘deep between their banks.' But a comparison
of Lucr. 2. 362 (in the same connexion as this)‘ summis labentia
ripis,’ and Quint. 12. 2 ‘ Ut vis amnium maior est altis ripis mul-
toque gurgitis tractu fluentium quam tenuis aquae et obiectu
lapillorum resultantis,’ would suggest that if Horace wrote ‘altis
ripis 'he meant rather ‘high up its banks,' so that it comes to the
same as ’τίνί53

27. obstrepunt, se. ‘audientibus,' see Od.3.30. 10. Markland
founded on Prop. 4. 4. 4 ‘Multaque nativis obstrepit arbor aquis,’
gn ingenious conj. ‘ frondes' for ‘fontes,' ‘lymphis’ being then the

ative.

28. quod, sc. ‘murmur quod.'

29-36. We pass to winter amu-sements.

29. tonantis, an epithet of the god which has become almost

a part of his name; but it serves to recall his influence on the
weather and responsibility for storms, although thunder is rather
an accessory of summer storms.

annus hibernus, the wintry part of the year, as ‘frigidus annus‚’
Virg. Aen. 6. 311. ‘Jove' 5 winter’ is the winter which m its season
Jove brings round again, C. S. 32 ‘ Iovis aurae!

32. obstantis,‘ set to stop them.’
33 levi, prob. ‘sssmooth though as ‘ames 'does not occur else·

where in poetry‚ it is not possible to pronounce certainly on the
quantity of its first syllable.

rara, ‘op'en‚ ‘wide-meshed‚’ see Con. on Virg. Aen. 4. 131.
The epithets, though, as has been remarked‚ more abundant than
Horace's maturet taste would have admitted, serve, by recalling
the circumstances, to recall the pleasures of the sport.

35. laqueo, a disyllable, not an anapaest, cp. Epod. 5. 79,
11. 23, and see Index of Metres.

37 foll. The ‘malae amoris curae,’ its follies and fancies and
jealousies, are left for the idle and luxurious life of the city. The
‘pudica uxor‘ and the pleasures of home are more likely to be
found in the country. Virg. G. 2. 523 ‘dulces pendent circum
oscula nati; Casta pudicitiam servat domus.' For the attraction
which makes ‘curas ’ agree with the relative, and leaves ‘ malarum '
without a subst., cp. Sat. 1. 4. 2 ‘alii quorum comoedia prisca
virorum est,’ Virg. Aen. 1. 573 ‘ urbem quam statuO, vestra est.’
