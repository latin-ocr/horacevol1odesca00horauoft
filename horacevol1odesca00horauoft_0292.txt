THE ODES OF HORACE

ibi, emphatic, repeating ‘ille,' as ‘tu . . . amici’ repeats ‘te
mecum.’ ‘There we will live and there I will die.’ ‘Eleganti
figura Septimium sibi superstitem fingit,' Porph.

calentem . . . favillam, of the solemn weeping at the pyre before
the ashes were extinguished by the pouring of wine, ‘ adhuc vivente
favilla,’ Stat. Silv. 2. 1. 2. Cp. Virg. Aen. 6. axz—218, 11. 184—194‚
especially v. 191, and Tib. 3. 3, especially v. 25.

ODE VII

‘WHAT, Pompeius at home again safe in limb and rights!
Pompeius who shared with me the dangers and the snatched
pleasures of the campaign under Brutus. After Philippi we
separated. Mercury carried me off in safety‚ you were swept back
again into the war. Surely you owe Jove a feast of thanksgiving.
My lawn shall be the scene of the revel. Who would think of
sobriety when a lost friend is found ? ’

‘Ad Pompeium Varum, ’ Acr.; and so the Ode is inscribed in
the oldest MSS Nothing is known of Pompeius. He has been
by some editors wrongly identified with Pompeius Grosphus, the

rich owner of pastures in Sicily, Epp. 1. 12. 21, Od. 2. 16.

At what point of the civil war Pompeius abandoned it and
availed himself of an offered amnesty, or what interval had elap sed
since then, there is no indication. Horace writes as if he phad
heard nothing of his old friend sor some years, and he has by this
time a lawn of his own on which he can entertain a guest. The
name of Pompeius suggests that he may have followed, after the
battle of Philippi, the fortunes of Sextus Pompeius, who maintained
the war by sea against the Triumvirs till the year Β. c. 35.

Ι have noticed (Introd. to Odes i-iii, ξ 13) that Horace chooses
this place in the middle of the Book which is the least political for
thle reminiscence of his boyish indiscretion and for his tribute to
a ost cause.

crisis, time of special import.

2. deducte. .duee, perhaps (as Di111.and Ritter think) with
a slight play on the two words, as though that were the point to
which Brutus’ leadership led them.

3. quis redonavit? merely a question of wonder, ‘how came
you here?’ not intended to be answered by ‘Maecenas’ or
‘Augustus.' This wonder at seeing Pompeius safe again is the
