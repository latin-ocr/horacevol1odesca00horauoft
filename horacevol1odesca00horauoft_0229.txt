BOOKx 1, ODE XV, 20——ODE XVI, 5

For the first view, which identifies the unknown object of this
palinode with the Tyndaris of the following Ode, there seems to be
no external argument. There was the temptation to connect the
two Odes, to make the invitation of that the complement of the
reconciliation in this3 and the connexion of the name of Helen on
the one side with the name of Tyndaris, and on the other with the
griginall ‘palinode,’ would easily suggest to ingenious Scholiasts the

esire link.

With respect to the second view the case is not so clear. If the
‘ criminosi iambi’ here recanted are to be looked sor among Horace’s
extant poems, they can hardly be other than his attacks on Canidia
in Epodes 5 and 17. To our ideas it is a slight recantation for
such a libel, so much so that it might seem to force us to give both
to the Epodes and to Sat. 1. 8 less reality than we should naturally
give. There is no bitterness in this Ode, nothing which would

justify us in holding (sor this is one suggestion) that it is a continua-

tion of the libel, the ‘tu pudica, tu proba ’ which he offered to sing
‘mendaci lyra,’ ‘ tuning his harp to falsehood,’ in Epod. 17. 39 3 but
yet the tone of the palinode is barely serious. There is a mock
heroic air in the ‘urbes altae,' ‘Thyestes,' ‘ Prometheus’ (comp.
Od. 2. 4, 4. 11. 25 foll„ and Epod. 3). It is intended, as Newman
says, to make the occasion slightly ridiculous, to represent both
himself and the lady as having made too much of it.

The παλινῳδία of Stesichorus, which added to the legend of Troy
the famous variation that it was only a phantom in Helen’s shape
that Paris carried from Mycenae, is mentioned by Plato, Phaedr.

’ 243 A, who quotes the first three lines :—

⁴-zul‘a11-V->L' ¹

οὔκ ἐστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος
οὐδ’ ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμοις
οὐδ’ ἵκεο Πέργαμα Τροίας.

Acron’s statement, ‘ Stesichorum imitatur,’ can barely mean more
than that Horace took from him the ideaof a ‘palinode’ Ritter
suggests that the first line may be an echo of some line in which
Stesichorus addressed Helen as sairer than her mother Leda.

2. modum pones, ‘ modum ponere‚' ‘to set bounds,’ ‘cupidinibus,
orationi,’ &c., are common expressions, cp. Od. 3. 15. 2 ‘nequitiae
fige modum! There is a play in its extension here to mean simply
‘to put an end to,' i.e. ‘destroy.’ The verses have been intem-
perate, the lady shall put bounds to them in the only possible way.

ᾗ Compare Ovid's trope, ‘ Emendaturis ignibus,’ Trist. 4. 10. 62.

⁴3. pones, the permissive future, ‘you shall if you wish‚' see on

,ἶ Od. 1. 6. 1.

4. Hadriano, see on Od. 1. 1. 14.
5—7. ‘Ira furor brevis est.' ‘No divine afflatus makes those it

* possesses so reckless as the passion of anger.'

5. Dindymene, ‘Dea Dindymi,’ Cat. 62. 91, Dindymus was
a mountain in Phrygia where Cybele was worshipped.
