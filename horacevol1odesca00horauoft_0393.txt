26. oivieam, ‘of citizens against citizens! See on 1. 2. 21
‘audiet civis acuisse ferruml

27.Pate1· urbium. It is impossible to doubt that Horace had
in mind the historic title of great patriots, ‘ Pater Patriae,' which,
though it had not yet been conferred on Augustus by the Senate,
may yet have been currently given to him by his partisans (see on
1. 2. 50); but the form ‘ Pater urbium’ is taken rather from the
more special designatione given to their benefactors by particular
towns. Orelli quotes an inscription to Augustus from Jadera,
a colony in Illyria, IMP. CAESAR mvl F. AUG. PARENS COLONIAE
MURUM ET TURRES DEDIT. Cicero bids his brother (ad Q. Fr.
1.1) deserve the title of ‘parens Asiae! This general benefactor
is to be recognized as such from city to city, to have in each his
statue with the memorial of his public services.
h28. subscribi, i. e. to have his name inscribed at the bottom of
t e statues.

29. refrenare licentiam, cp. 4. 15. 9, where Horace proclaims
that Augustus has accomplished this task‚ ‘ ordinem Rectum
evaganti frena licentiae Iniecit.’

30. quatenus, ‘ since‚’ Sat. 1. 1. 64, 2. 3. 76.

31, 32. For the sentiment cp. 2. 1. 10-14, and the verses attri-
buted to Menanders Δεινοὶ γὰρ ἀνδρὶ πάντες ἐσμὲν εὔκλεεῖ Ι ζῶντι
φθονῆσαι κατθανόντα δ’ αἰνέσαι.

32. quaerimus, ποθοῦμεν, ‘requirimus‚’ ‘we look for without
finding)

invidi goes with both clauses; it is the clue to the apparent
inconsistency.

33. querimoniae, lamentations in the senate, in society, in
literature, over the evils of the time.

35. leges sine moribus, cp. 4. 5. 22, where Augustus is repre-
sented as having touched both springs of reformation: ‘ Mos et lex
maculosum edomuit nefas! ⁸

37, 38. pare, latue; cp. 3. 3. 55 ‘Qua parte debacchentur ignes’3
1. 22. 19 ‘ Quod latus mundi nebulae malusque Iuppiter urget.’

37. inclusa, ‘fenced in,’ as if the heats were intended to bar it
from human intrusion. ‘Terra domibus negata,’ ibid. Virg. Aen.
7. 227 ‘ si quem . . . dirimit plaga solis iniqui.’

39. solo, ablative of place.

40 foll. The whole passage is an echo of parts of Od. 1. 3. Cp.
v. 43 with ‘audax omnia perpeti,’ &c. The ‘ mercator' is always
Horace’s type of the eager pursuit of wealth, see Od. 1. 31. 10 foll„
Epp. 1. 1. 45 foll. To cross the sea is to fly in the face of the

‘prudens Deus,’ who put that barrier between land and land.

40. eallidi3 cp. Soph. Ant. 335 foll„ summing up the triumph of
man’s wit: τοῦτο καὶ πολιοῦ πέραν πόντου χειμερίῳ νότῳ Ι χωρεῖ.

. . arduae' are both constructed after‘ si.' The asyndeton serves
to point out that the two last clauses are not fresh instances of that
