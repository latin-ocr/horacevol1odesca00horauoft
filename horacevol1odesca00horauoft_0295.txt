BOOK II, ODE VII, 12--ODE VIII, 10

27. Edonis. He is thinking rather of the' Thracian orgies
(‘ bacchabor ¹) than of their reputation for excessive drinking (1. 27.
1), though the two things were really one.

28. furere, Od. 3. 19. 18 ‘Insanire iuvat’ ; 4. 12. 28 ‘dulce est
desipere in loco! They are probably from the Pseudo-Anacreon 3
θέλω θέλω μανῆναι.

ODE VIII

‘N0, Barine, if you ever suffered in the least degree for for-

· swearing yourself, Ι would believe your oaths now; but you thrive on

it, and only become the more beautiful and the more popular. The
gods who ought to punish you only laugh. Fresh lovers crowd to
you, and the old ones, in spite of your faithlessness, will not

forsake you.'

The effect of this Ode, as following the seventh‚ is the same
as that which has been noticed in the sequence of Od. 1. 11, 12,
13; 1. 37, 38. See Introd. to Odes i—iii, § 12.

1-5. Diur. points out the art which is expended in the collocation
of this stanza. The point is the contrast between the little he
demands, brought out by the emphatic position of ‘ ulla,' ‘umquam,'
‘ dente,' ‘ uno,’ ‘ ungui,’ and the large offer which he makeS, brought
out by the single unqualified ‘ crederem,’ the equivalent, in a single
word, for the whole stanzaful of offered conditions. For a similarly
balanced sentence, see 3. 3. 30-33.

1. iuris peierati, an· expression apparently coined by Horace
for a ‘ false or broken oath' to follow the analogy of ‘ ius-iurandum!
Aer. vouches for the phrase ‘ius iuratum‚’ but it does not seem to
be found anywhere.

3. uno, with ‘ dente' as well as with ‘ungui‚' see on 1. 2. 1.

4. turpior, in point of grammar, goes with both ablatives, in
point of sense it has more duty to discharge to that to which it is
attached, as ‘ dente' has its special kind of deformity named.

6. eaput. From the habit of swearing by the head, Virg. Aen
9. 300, &c. The ‘vota' are imprecations on herself if her promises
should not be kept.

7. hiuvenum publiea eura, ‘to break the hearts of all our

out .’
y prodis, ‘ go abroad ’ (Od. 3. 14. 6), to seek and win admiration.

9. expedit, sc. ‘tibi,' not a generalization. ‘ It is positive gain
to you.’

10. fallere, ‘to swear falsely by,’ as V irg. Aen. 6. 324 ‘Di cuius
iurare timent et fallere numen! For such oaths the commentators
compare Prop. 2. 20. 15 ‘ Ossa tibi iuro per matris et ossa parentis;
Si fallo, cinis heu sit mihi uterque gravis ’3 Virg. Aen. 6. 458 ‘per
sidera iur0, Per superos, et si qua fides tellure sub ima est.'

taciturna, the epithet seems meant to suggest the awfulness of
night, Epod. 5. 52.
