the ‘pudica uxor,' &c.‚ and vv. 37, 38.

in partem, ἐν μέρει, ‘ for her share?

iuvet, with a zeugma. It is the appropriate verb only with
‘ domum,’ ‘ graces,’ ‘helps.' By uniting closely the two substantives,
‘the horne with its blooming children‚' we can bring ‘ dulcis
liberos ’ into some recognizable relation to it, but still the new
substantive breathes into the verb a new idea of ‘helping to
govern,' which does not belong to it properly, and which was not
needed so long as it was only constructed with‘ domum. ’

41. Sabina, Od. 3. 6. 37 foll„ Virg. G. 2. 532.

42. per-mois = ‘strenui’ ‘impiger Apulus,’ Od. 3. 16. 26. The

Apuli, see on Od. 1. 22. 13 and 3. 5. 9. Ἴ

43. exstruat, a natural asyndeton, which Lambinus and others
needlessly fill up by reading ‘ sacrum et' or ‘ sacrumque. ’ ξ

Ionicarum gustus attagenarurn.’ It is said to be the heathcock. *1

59. His vegetable diet is varied with meat on rare occasions, on
the festival of Terminus (Feb. 23, cp. Ov. Fast. 2. 639 foll.), or
when a kid has been torn by a wolf but snatched from his mouth.

Cp. Martial's Cenula (¹0: 48. 14)‘ haedus inhumani raptus ab ore
