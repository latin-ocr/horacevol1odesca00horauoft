BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE V, 1-15

‘sequiturque (nefas) Aegyptia coniux,' and Liv. 43. 3 ‘ex militibus
Romanis et ex Hispanis mulieribus cum quibus connubium non
esset natos se memorantes)

6. vixit, as its place shows, emphatic, ‘has endured life‚’ has
bought life at such a price.

7. pro ouria, the senate,’ as in 2. 1. 14 ‘consulenti curiae.’
The force of‘ inversi' is thrown back upon ‘curia 'after Horace’ s
manner: see on 1. 2. 1, cp. 1. 5. 5 ‘ fidem mutatosque deos.’ The
senate is changed, and the whole spirit of morals and discipline, of
which it was the guardian, is' overset. Compare the part played by
the senate in the subsequent story of Regulus, ν. 45.

8. socerorum, of the race into which he has married. So in
Virg3 Aen. 11. 105 ‘Parceret hospitibus quondam socerisque νρεειῐί5’;
and it is from the Greek. Hom. Il. 3. 49 νυὸν ἀνδρῶν αἰχμητάων, and
Theocr. 24. 82 ’γαμβρὸς ἀθανάτων.

in armis. Cp. Justin’ s account of the practice of the Parthians,
41. 2. 5 ‘exercitum non ut aliae gentes liberorum, sed maiorem
partem servitiorum habent‚’ and the story (quoted by Merivale
from Flor. 4. 10, and Vell. Patere. 2. 82) of the assistance rendered
to the expedition of M. Antonius by a Roman in the Parthian ranks,
‘qui clade Crassiani exercitus captus . . . fortunam non animum
mutasset!

9. sub rege, ‘invidiosum apud Romanos nomen,’ Orelli.

Marsus et Apulus. The Marsi (cp. 2. 20. 18 ‘qui dissimulat
metum Marsae cohortis') are distinguished by other writers, as
Virg. G. 2. 167 ‘genus acre virum Marsos.’ The Apulian is named
as a fellow-countryman of the poet 3 see on 1. 22. 13.

10. anciliorum, as if the genitive of ‘ancilium’; so ‘vecti-
galiorum‚’ Suet. Aug. c. 101. For a collection of similar cases see
Macrob. Saturn. 1. 4. The ‘ancile ’ was one of the pledges of the
eternity of Rome. For the legend of its descent from heaven, and
for the meaning of the plural ‘ ancilia,' see Ov. Fast. 3. 345-384.

togae, Virg. Aen. 1. 282‘ gentem togatam?

13 foll. ‘It was this danger which Regulus had foreseen when he
counselled the senate not to ransom himself and his fellow captives.’
The danger which he foresaw was, that if there were the hope of
ransom, Roman soldiers would come to prefer captivity to a brave
death. Now they had come to acquiesce in it, so much as even to
forget their own country.

15. trahentis== ‘ derivantis.' ‘ Tracing the stream of ruin that
would flow to future ages from the precedent, if, ’ ἃς. No exact
parallel for the phrase‘ perniciem trahere' in the sense of ‘ to trace
the stream of ruin ’has been alleged; though the metaphor of the
stream is common enough, as 5. 6. 19‘ Hoc sonte derivata clades
In patriam populumque fluxit’ ;but as we say of one who points
out a ‘derivation’ that he‘ derives,' so in Latin the idea of actually
