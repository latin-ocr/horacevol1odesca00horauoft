INTRODUCTION TO THE ODES, BOOKS 1-111

the two exceptions being made up in Ode 11. The alternation of
Sapphics and Alcaics‘ through more than half of B. ii seems
another instance.

ξ 17. As with metre so with subject and tone, the great aim in
the arrangement seems to be variety. The key is to be changed as
often as possible. If two or more Odes are unusually like one
another they are relieved by a stronger contrast. We pass from
persona} topies to public, from friendship to love, from real persons
to shadows, from banter to earnestness, from the philosophy of life
to its pleasures, from the tone of the Stoic to that of the Epicurean.
While this is the general principle, we can sometimes see, probably
we oftener fail from ignorance to see, some link of association‚
either through similarity or contrast, which would guide the
arrangefis hand, consciously or unconsciously, in placing one
Ode next to another. 1 have suggested such links sometimes
in the notes, but the ground is not substantial enough fot further
generalization.
