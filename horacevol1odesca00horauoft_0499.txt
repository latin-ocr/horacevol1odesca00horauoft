EPODE xv11, 28-6 5

feriae,’ &c. But it seems also to have been used of the special
ceremonies which, at Rome as well as in Greece, took place on tlte
m'ntlz day after death, τὰ ἔνατα. We are dependent for our informa-
tion chiefly on the Scholiasts upon this place, upon Virg. Aen. 5.
64, and Terent. Phorm. r. 1.³16‚ and they differ in their accounts
of the employment of the intervening days. But all agree that the
ninth day was the one on which the dead was finally put out of sight.

50. venter=‘ partus.' The allusion is to the taunt in Epod. 5. 5.

Pactumeius Orelli shows to have been a Roman name. It
occurs in the consular lists of the two first Christian centuries.

52. fortis exsilis, of her speedy recovery. Intended to retract
the retractation.

56, 59. ut . . . ut3 Madv. ξ 353 obs. Of something not to be
thought of, whether as improbable or as offensive ; Cic. Cat. 1. 9. 22
‘ Quamquam quid loquor? Te ut ulla res frangat. Tu ut unquam
te corrigas? It more often has an interrogative particle added;
Hor. Sat. 2. 5. 18 ‘ Utne tegam spurco Damae latus?'

56. riseris vulgata, i. e. ‘vulgaveris et riseris.’

cotyttia, licentious mysteries celebrated in Thrace, and later in
Athens and Corinth, in the name of a goddess Cotys or Cotytto.
Canidia gives this name to the dark rites described in Epod. 5,
with their lustful purpose.

58. pontifex. A ‘pontifex’ had the right and duty of being
present at all sacred rites‚ and of seeing that they were duly
performed. Horace has acknowledged in Sat. 1. 8 his cognisance
of Canidia’s doings on the Esquiline. She turns the tables on him.
He was there as a very' master in the art, and yet has held her up
to public scorn. Orelli quotes the title which Cicero gives Clodius
on account of his unlawful presence at the rites of Bona Dea, pro
Sest. 17. 39 ‘stuprorum sacerdotem?

60-62. ‘What profit, then, were it to me [i. e. if you could do this
with impunity] to have made the fortune of Pelignian hags [i.e. to
have paid for learning every secret of magic]‚ and to have mixed
the speediest poison? But [though I do not mean to let you off,
and though I call my poison speedy] the fate that awaits you is all
too slow for your desire.’ B has ‘proderat‚’ which is defended by
Bentley. There is good MS. authority for ‘si’ against ‘sed' in
v. 62. The question must then be removed to the end of ν. 62, and
the sentence will refer to Horace, not to Canidia, ‘What will it
profit you richly to have paid Pelignian hags (i.e. to find spells
that might free you from me), or to have mixed the quickest poison
gi. e: in order to kill yourself), if a fate awaits you too slow sor your

eS1res.’

61. veloeiUS, sc. ‘solito.'

62. tardiora answers verbally to ‘ velocius.’

63. in hoe, ‘for this purpose!

65. infidi, in his treatment of Myrtilus. Tantalus' character is
to be gathered from that of his son.
