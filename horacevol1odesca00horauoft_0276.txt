THE ODES OF HORACE

expressed in the infinitive clause. For the Liburnian galleys see
on3÷.p(1))‹i·iriat1a‚ ‘unqueened.’ The nominative is after the Greek
idiom. Porph. and Acr. quote Livy for the statement that Cleopatra
‘ cum de industria ab Augusto in captivitate indulgentius tractaretur
identidem dicere solitam fuisse οὐ θριαμβεύσομαι.’

ODE XXXVIII

A SLlGHT Ode, expressive of the modest avoidance of pomp and
luxury which Horace professes and recommends.

For the meaning of its position at the end of the book, and
immediately after the Ode on Cleopatra’s death, cp. the position
of Od. 3. 7, and see Introduction to Odes i-iii,§ 12 and notes on

2. 1. 37, 3. 3. 69, 3. 5. 55.

1. Persicos, of oriental luxury. Ritter quotes Tae. Ann. 2. 57
‘Vox quoque eius [sc. Pisonis] audita est in convivio, cum apud
regem Nabataeorum coronae aureae magno pondere Caesari et
Agrippinae, leves Pisoni et ceteris offerrentur, principis Romani

2. nexae philyra. φιλύρα was the Greek name of the lime tree,
Lat. ‘tilia ’ ; but it is used in Latin for the fibrous inner bark of that
tree (Herod. 4. 67), which was employed, amongst other purposes,
in making garlands (Plin. N. H. 16. 25. 14). Ovid calls such
garlands ‘ sutiles,’ Fast. 5. 335. q

3. quo. Mr. Shilleto (on Thuc. 1. 89) explains this as an instance
of attraction and absorption of the antecedent, ‘quo'=‘eo ubi:

comparing Ter. Adelph. 2. 1. 36‘illuc redi quo occepisti.’ It is Δ
perhaps better to take ‘ sectari ' as only a picturesque substitute for ς
‘ quaerere’ and admitting the same construction, and ‘ quo loco· ·

rum ’ as=⁴ quo loco! Cicero has ‘ quo loci ’3 see F ore. s. v.
4. sera, the time would seem to be autumn.
· 5. allabores‚ a word peculiar to Horace = ‘laborando addas.’

6. euro. Bentley conjectures ‘cura’ (imperative), thinking ‘curo’ Δ

not a sufficiently peremptory way of expressing a wish to a slave

‘ ni Saturnalia tunc agebantur.' But the negative really qualifies it, .

so that it=‘ non curo quicquam sedulus allabores.'
7. arta, not allowed to throw its arms abroad, but tied close over

a trellis, or otherwise, so as to give shade.
