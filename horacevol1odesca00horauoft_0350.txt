THE ODES OF HORACE

teneretur non esse se senatorem. Atque illud etiam (O stultum
hominem-dixerit· quispiam,-—et repugnantem utilitati suae!) reddi
captivos negavit esse utile: illos enim adolescentis esse et bonos
duces, se iam confectum senectute. Cuius cum valuisset auctoritas
captivi retenti sunt; ipse Karthaginem rediit: neque eum caritas
patriae retinuit nec suorum. Neque vero tum ignorabat se ad
crudelissimum hostem et ad exquisita supplicia proficisci: sed
iusiurandum conservandum putabat.’

Compare de Senect. 20, de Fin. 5. 27, pro Sest. 59, in Pis. 19
ιΜ. Regulus quem Karthaginienses resectis palpebris illigatum in
machina vigilando necaverunt.’

It will be observed that the argument against ransoming Roman
soldierS, as it appears in the Ode, is an addition to the story.

1. eaelo, with ‘regnare‚’ opposed to ‘ praesens! Jupiter in
heaven, Caesar upon earth, Ι. 12. 51, 58.

credidimus, a perf„ ‘so much the world has already come to
believe.’

2. praesens divus, opposed to the unseen gods of heaven; cp.
1. 2. 45 ‘ serus in caelum redeas! It suggests, perhaps, at the same
time its more usual sense of ‘ present to bless ’ ; cp. 4. 14. 43 ‘ tutela
praesens Italiae,’ V irg. E. 1. 43-45, where Augustus is the ‘praesens
divus' in both senses.

3. Britannis. Cp. 1. 35. 29, where Augustus is spoken of as
meditating the same two exploits‚ ⁴ Serves iturum Caesarem in
ultimos Orbis Britannos et iuvenum recens Examen Eois timendum
Partibus Oceanoque rubro.’

4. imperio, see on 1. 2. 26.

gravibus Persis, see on 1. 2. 21.

5. milesne. This burst of indignation‚ the more forcible for the
conventional tone of the first stanza‚ is immediately suggested by
the mention of the hateful Parthians. Augustus is to subject them
to the Roman sway. ‘ Can it be that Roman soldiers have borne
to live, to marry, and grow old as their slaves? What a change
from the old spirit, the spirit of Regulus ! ’

Crassi. M. Licinius Crassus Dives, the rival of Caesar and
Pompey, and sharer with them in the league sometimes called the
First Triumvirate, was defeated, Β, C. 53, at Carrhae in Mesopo-
tamia, by SurenaS, general of Orodes Ι ; 20,000 Romans were said
to have been taken prisonem, and 20,000 left dead, amongst whom
was Crassus.

coniuge barbara. Neither with ‘turpis,’ as Ritter takes it, nor
necessarily with ‘maritus‚' as Dillr. and Orelli, though they support
it by Ov. Her. 4. 1. 34 ‘fratre marita soror’; but an ablative
‘absolute ’ as much as ‘ te duce‚’ ἃς. (see on 2. 1. 12), an ablative
of the circumstance which justifies the whole appellation ‘turpis
maritus,‘ the collo‘cation pa‘iring, in ,H‘orace's mapner, the, οοξξ-
