EPODE 1, 9—EPODE 11, 8

30. Circaea, as he calls the same hill in Od. 3. 29. 8 ‘Telegoni
iuga parricidae,’ q. v.

31. Cp. Od. 2. 18. 52, 3. 16. 38.

33. Chremes, apparently a miser of comedy, like the Euclio of
the Aulularia, but the play or author is not known.

34. discinctus. The word is used literally or with no sense
further than ‘at one’s ease‚’ in Sat. 2. 1. 73. It has got here, and
in later authors, the sense of careless, loose, profligate; partly
through the association of this mode of dress with idle and luxurious
habits, partly through the metaphorical colour borrowed from the
already established use of ‘dissolutus’ In the text the second ‘ ut ’
is understood3 some MSS. supply it.

EPODE II

HORACE gives a point to his praises of country life by putting
them into the mouth of a money—lender notorious sor his keenness
in his trade. Cp. the saying attributed apparently to the same
person, the ‘fenerator Alfius,’ by Columella (1. 7) ‘vel optima
nomina non appellando fieri mala‚’ ‘that the best debtors become
bad ones if you let them alone! There does not seem to be any
attempt to make the usurer speak in character through the poem ;
the pleasures named are those which any Roman poet would have
named (cp. Virg. G. 2. 493 foll„ Tibull. 1. 1 foll.)‚ and they are no
doubt such as Horacefeels himself. The irony of the conclusion
(‘so the most unlikely people say, although their acts again give
the lie to it ’), as Sellar points out, is like the ironical conclusion of
so many Odes: Horace will not press too hard even his praises
of country life: but the character of the irony is due to the nature
of the poem; it turns an Idyll into an Epode. Its point is rather
the strength of the ‘ ruling passion ' (cp. the ‘ mercator ’ of Od. 1. 1.
16, who in the storm ‘ otium et oppidi Laudat rura sui ; mox reficit
ratis Quassas ⁹) than, as has been suggested, the elaborate hypocrisy
of a money-lender who makes his panegyric on a rustic life an
excuse for pressing his debtors for repayment‚ while he means
all the while to put the money out to interest again at the next
settlement-day.

The diction of the Epode reminds us constantly of the GeorgiCS.

3. exercet, of continuous labour at anything‚ Virg. G. 1. 99
‘ Exercetque frequens tellurem.'

4. solutus omni faenore. He has nothing to do with usurers ;
llilis gand came to him from his father3 his bullocks were bred on

1s arm.

5,- 6. He is not a soldier to have his sleep broken by the bugle,
nor a trader to sear storms at sea.

7, 8. Cp. Virg. G. 2. 501 ‘nec ferrea iura Insanumque sorum
. . . vidit,’ and ib. 503 ‘alii . . . penetrant aulas et >limina regum.’
