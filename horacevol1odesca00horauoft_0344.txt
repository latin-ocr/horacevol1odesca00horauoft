THE ODES OF HORACE

11. Hom. Il. 10. 98 καμάτῳ ἀδδηκότες ῆὸἑ καὶ ὕπνῳ. For the
position of ‘que’ see on 1. 3ο. 5.

13. mirum quod foret. The subjunctive expresses, if not a
purpose, at least a result foreseen at the time of the action: ‘to be
the marvel of all that,' &c. Cp. Virg. E. 9. 48 ‘ processit . . . Astrum
quo segetes gauderent frugibus?

14. nidum Acherontiae, of a town nestling, where you would
not look for it, on a ledge of a hill. So Cic. de Orat. 1. 44 ‘Ithacam
illam in asperrimis saxulis tamquam nidulum affixam? Acerenza
retains the name and site of the ancient town. ‘It is built on
a hill of considerable elevation, precipitous on three sides, and 2
affording only a very steep approach on the fourth! ζ

15. Bantinos, on the borders of Lucania and Apulia, for Pliny ¹
speaks of it as belonging to the former, Livy to the latter. The a}
name is preserved in the convent of Sta· Maria di Banzi. ξ

16. Forenti. The name (Forenza) still remains in the locality‚ ⁴
but is at present applied to a village on a hill. Acr. speaks of the ¹
ancient village having been deserted in his time, ‘ nunc sine habita· ἓ
tore est.' 4

17. ut. . . . ut, explaining the subject of their wonder, ‘how it
eguld be that I slept‚’ &a Horace has ‘mirabimur ut’ in Epod.
1 . 3. ·

18⁵. sacra, the bay to Apollo, the myrtle to Venus3 and so they
are emblematic both of the future poet and specially of the poet of
love. ‘ Collata,’ like ‘ sacra,' is intended to cover both substantives.
See 2. 1 . 18-20 n.

20. ngn Sine dis, οὗ θεῶν ἄτερ, οὐκ decet (Homgod. 18. 353).
This is their explanation of the marvel: ‘such bravery in a babe
must come from the gods, and must be under their special pro-
tection.’ ‘And so it was,’ Horace continues, ‘I was under the
Muses’ care, and have been all my life?

22. tollor, the Muses take him, as a god snatches a hero from
the fight in Homer, and carry him up ‘in montis et in arcem ex
urbe’ (Sat. 2. 6. 16). Cp. Od. 2. 7. 13.

Sabinos. My Sabine estate. See on Od. 2. 18. 14.

seu . . . seu . . . seu. An apodosis must be applied to each
supposition, ‘or if Praeneste be my choice, or Tibur, or Baiae,’ ‘ibi
vester sum,’ ‘ eo vester feror? The epithets contrast the situations z ¹:
the breezy hill-top (Praeneste is 2100 feet above the sea), the ξ
sloping hill-side (‘supinum’ must refer to the S. W. side of Tibur, gf
when}1 the hill slopes gently towards the Campagna), and the
sea-s ore.

25. amioum, the welcome guest in the haunts of the Muses. .
1. 26. 1 ‘ Musis amicus! ³·

fontibus et choris, 1. 26. 6; Hes. Theog. 3 (of the Muses) καί ἶ
τε πὲρὶιιὶεῆιὲηνὴῖοειδέιέ πῗιέσιζθίξπαᾈιίῖσιν Ι ὀρχεῦνται.

2 . 0 t erou a lippi, 2.7. 13.

27. devota, sc. ‘ dis inferis: and so ‘accursed.’ Epod. 16. 9.

arbos, 2. 13 passim, 2. 17. 27, 3. 8. 7.
