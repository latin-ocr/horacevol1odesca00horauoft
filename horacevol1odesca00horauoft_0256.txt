THE ODES OF HORACE

sagittas tendere. Virgil has the same inversion, ‘spicula tendere i

cornu,' Aen. 9. 606.

Sericas. This illustrates the ‘Mede' or Parthian os v. 4: it is ἐξ
i

the whole East that Iccius is going to conquer3, see on Od. 1.
1213.6 arduis montibus. It may be doubted whether this is a

dative case like Od. 1.24. 18, or an abl. absol. on the analogy j

of‘ adverso, secundo, fluminess ‘up the steep mountains’ side?

Notice the antithetical position of the two adjectives‘ arduis pro· ·’

nos) Eur. Med. 410 ἅνω ποταμῶν ἷερῶν χωροῦσι παγαί, Ι καὶ δίκα καὶ
πάντα πάλιν στρέφεται.

13. nobilis. The MSS. are fairly divided between ‘nobilis’
and‘ nobiles) but it must be remembered that‘ nobilis’ may still

be the accusative plural. The arrangement of the words is in ἶ

favour of the genitive, as pairing, after Horace’s way, the substan-
tives and epithets. In support of the genitive are quoted Epp.
1. 19. 39 ‘nobilium scriptorum ’3 Cic. Phil. 5. 5 ‘ Phaedri philosophi

nobilis! In support of the accusative, A. P. 258 ‘Acci nobilibus >

trimetris’3 Mart. 7. 97. 8 ‘Turni . . . nobilibus libellis'3 and
A. Gell. 13. 27 ‘ Panaetii tribus illis inclytis libris.’

14. Panaeti, the Stoic philosopher and the friend of Scipio ζ’
Africanus Minor. His great work was a treatise περὶ τοῦ καθήκοντος, ,

which was the basis of Cicero's de Officiis.
Socraticam domum, A. P. 310 ‘ Socraticae chartae,’ the writings
of Plato, Xenophon, &c. ‘Domus ’ is used for a school of philo·

sophy by Sen. Epp. 29 ‘Idem hoc omnes tibi ex omni domo
acclamabunt, Peripatetici, Academici, Stoici, Cynici.’ Cp. Cicero’s
phrase, de Div. 2. 1. 3 ‘Peripateticorum familia,’ and Horace ξ

himself, Epp. 1. 1. 13‘ quo me duce, quo lare, tuter!

15. ’Hiberia Spanish steel was famous, Plin. N. H. 34. 41 f

ᾖῐιῖ16.43ί;θιιὸ.1ει, for‘ tendere,’ of purpose or effort, with infinitive, cp.
Epp. 1. 7. 31, 1. 19. 16, Virg. Aen. 1. 18.

ODE XXX

‘QUEEN VENUS‚ leave Cyprus and bring thy presence to the ᾗ

shrine which Glycera offers thee, and bring with thee love and
grace and youth and wit)

³}

The odeis a hymn of the kind which the Greeks caued afflat,

hymns of invitation; see on Alcman, Fr. 10. ed. Bergk, Κύπρον
ἱμερτὰν λιποῖσα καὶ Πάφον περιρρύταν, a line of which we may
possibly hear an echo in ‘Sperne dilectam Cypron?

1'11222321, in cyprus3 Hom. ogs 8. 362 ‘a δ’ ἄρα Κύπρον ἵκανε
