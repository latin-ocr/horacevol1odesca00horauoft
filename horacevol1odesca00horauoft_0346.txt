THE ODES OF HORACE

41. eonsilium, a trisyllable‚ the penult. being lengthened before 1,
and the semiconsonantal i==y. So in 3. 6. 6 ‘Hinc omne prin-
cipium! Cp. Virgil's use of ‘tenuia,’ G. 1. 3973 ‘fluviorum,' ib.
482, &c.

dato gaudetis almae They not only give gentle counsels, but
when they have given them they rejoice to further them; for in
respect to them, as in all other respectS, they are ‘.almae’ This
epithet stands last, as summing up the beneficent character of the
Muses, which has been the theme of the first half of the Ode, and
as leading us by the association of contrast to the impersona'tions
of brute and insensate force, whose vain efforts and doom are the
subject of the latter half.

42. seimus ut,‘ we all know how? The preceding stanzas have
been professedly addressed to the Muses. ‘Scimus’ reminds us
that it is really a homily addressed to Horace' s contemporaries,
who had witnessed, so he hints, a repetition of the Gigantomachia.
The same comparison is hinted in Od.2.12.6-10.

43. immanemque, the‘ que’ adding only another designation
of the same object.

If we must go by a mere majority of older MSS. we must read
‘turbam’ here, and‘ turmas' in v. 47.

44. caduco, καταιβάτης κεραυνός, Aesch. P. V. 358. Here, as in
2. 13. 11, the adjective has something of that sense of‘ proneness to
fall,’ which Bentley (ad loc.) rightly holds to be prop er to it. The
bolt hung ready to fall: a touch launched it. The adjective
heightens our feeling of the ease with which the Titans were swept
away. Bentley condemns it here, as merely equivalent to ‘cadente,'
and would therefore alter it to ‘ corusco, ’ which would hardly be an
epithet of sufficient point to occupy the emphatic place.

45 48. The universality of Jove' s rule is indicated not only by
the nouns ‘terramss ‘,mare ’.διε which describe his triple empire in
earth, in Hades, in heaven, but also by the triple contrast of the
epithets expressed or implied: the ‘dull earth’ (‘ bruta,’ 1. 34. 9)
and the ‘ sea stirred by every wind,’ ‘the [busy] cities of the livin
and the sad realm of the shades,’ ‘the [‘ quieti ordines’ of the
gods and the turmoil of mortal men.' However much they differ
in all else, they are all alike subject to his sway. For Horace's
manner of marking a contrast by giving an epithet to one only
of the two things contrasted see on 2. 3. 9, 3. 13. 7, 4. 4. 10. Note
also that the epithets actually given are all such as imply some
difficulty or unlikelihood in the way of his rule. He can sway the
earth, however insensate it be3 the sea, however stormy; the sad
shadow- world, as well as the world of men; the turmoil of earth, as
well as the quiet gods.

48. unus, for all their variety they have one ruler.

aequo, calm and just. It is the key ·note of the stanza; it
heightens our idea of his power, and describes its nature The
construction is, ‘qui temperat terram et mare, et regit urbes regna-
que, ’&c.
