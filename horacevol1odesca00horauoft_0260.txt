THE ODES OF HORACE Α

complete parallel to Juvenal’ 5 prayer for the‘ mens sana in corpore
sano, ’the insertion of‘ precor’ serving only to lay the greater stress
on the second prayer.

ODE XXXII

‘THEY call on us for a song. Corne, my lyre, I have drawn

emm

⁴ ·-. «τε» arbre:

strains from thee before which, light though they be, will not soon ’

die: answer now with such music for Roman ears as thou yieldedst
of old to Alcaeus. He was a patriot and a warrior, yet amidst his
wars and shipwrecks he found tirne to sing of wine and love. O lyre‚
the delight of gods, the solace of toil, help me too whenever I duly
call on thee!

It is not unlikely that the Ode refers to some request of Augustus Ᾰ

or Maecenas for a poem of a graver cast: Ritter thinks of the
stately Alcaic Odes which stand at the beginning of Book iii.
There is an appearance of reality in the appeal of the first stanza,
and in the pains which he takes to point out that lyrics on Lycus’
black hair were not inconsistent in Alcaeus’ case with civic zeal and
soldierly courage. It is written, like Od. 1. 1, 2. 20, 3. 30, when
Horace had become easy as to his own powers and their recogni-
tion by the world. See, however, on v. 1.

1. Poseimur. The MSS. are divided between this reading and
‘poscimus' ‘ Poscimur ’ is interpreted by Acr. and Comm. Cruq„

and is quoted by Servius on Virg. Ecl. 1. 10. The reading is
strongly supported by the occurrence of the same phrase several '³
times in Ovid, Fast. 4. 721 ‘Palilia poscor‚’ ‘I ain asked for a poem ‘.-

on the Palilia' ·.Met 5. 333 ‘Poscimur Aonidesss 4. 274 ‘Poscitur
Alcathoess ‘scilicet ut narret fabulamss Bentl.· There is a rival read-
ing ‘poscimus,' which has the authority of B and of Diomedes, and
which Bentl. supports. It seems to necessitate an alteration, which
he also adopts, in the mode of taking the whole stanza. He put

‘si quid. .tecum’ into a parenthesis, making ‘ quod et hunc in
annum vivat et pluris’ a description not of what Horace and his ἶ,
lyre have already sung, but of the greater song now asked for,

‘carmen 'being constructed’ απὸ κοινοῦ with‘ poscimus ’and ‘dic.⁹

It is obvious that this would alter the character of the poem. 1t j
would hardly lead us to think of any special occasion, and the tone ;

of confidence would have vanished from it.
