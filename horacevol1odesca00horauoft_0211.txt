of the agent, Sat. 1. 6. 12, διε. All other interpretations are more
forced. Orelli takes it ‘ to pluck the olive for a crown from every
quarter of Attic soil,’ i. e. to sing of every myth, event, glory of art,

that adorn Athens.
8. plurimus. There seems to be no other instance of ‘ plurimus'

without a subst. for ‘ plurimi.' Ritter will not allow the use, and
takes {plurimus in Iunonis honorem ' as = ‘ effusus in,’ as ‘ multus

esse in re nota,' Cic. de Or. 2. 87. But if Virgil says ‘ pluri-
mus oleaster,’ G. 2. 182, and Lucan, 3. 707, ‘multus sua vulnera
puppi Affixit moriens‚’ ‘ plurimus ’ may well be used for the plural
here.

12. domus Albuneae. Albunea was the Sibyl of Tibur. Her
temple here spoken of is usually identified now not with the ‘temple
of the Sibyl,’ as it is commonly called, but with the second ancient
temple, now the church of S. Giorgio, which stands close to it on the
brink of the precipitous ravine through which the ‘ old fall ' of the-

. Anio descends. The topography of Tibur is especially difficult on

>.. account of the changes which great inundations have caused in the
ἶῖ course of the Anio. One such is described in Plin. Epp. 8. 17.

Another, in A. D. 1826, led to the excavation of the tunnels through

ν the Monte Catillo, by which the larger part of the river is now con-

ducted to thep‘new falls ’ beyond the reach of the rocks on which

13. Tiburni, acc. to Virg. Aen. 7. 672, Tiburnus (Virg. calls him

‘ Tiburtus ’), Catillus (⁴ Catilus,’ Hor. Od. 1. 18. 2), and Coras were
‚j three Argive brothers, founders of Tibur.

15. albus, predicative. The south wind is sometimes λευκόνοτος,

not always ‘niger Auster.’ The lesson is that the very same wind
which brings the clouds will presently clear them. ‘Albus’ as
