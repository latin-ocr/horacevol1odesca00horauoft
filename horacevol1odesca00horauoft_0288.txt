THE ODES OF HORACE

force of ‘to love pre-eminently,' ‘to choose sor love’; ‘dilectam
Cypron,' ‘ Cyprus of thy choice’; compare Od. 2. 5. 17. ι

21. teretes, ‘ well-turned‚’ ‘shapely.'

23. octavum lustrum. Horace’s fortieth year ended on Dec. 8,
Β. C. 25. The ‘’lustrum was properly the sacrifice performed by
the censor after completing the quinquennial census. Horace
recalls, but avoids the technical phrase‘ condere lustrum? Liv. 1.
44. F’or the inf.‘ claudere’ see Ap. 2, ξ 1.

trepidavit, the stream has run quickly ; cp. ‘ curret aetas,' Od.

ODE V

‘LALAGE is not old enough for your advances. Let her be ζ’,
3 child a little longer. Have patience, she will come to you>

by and by, and return the love greater than you ever gave to ,
Pholoe or Chloris! ·’

     

‘Incertum est quem alloquatur hac Ode utrum amicorum aliquem ⁷
an se ipsum,’ Aer. Even if it be a soliloquy, the poetO may be -
addressing himself in an assumed character, as e. g.1 in (1.3 12. κ
The Ziirich MS. of the tenth century (τ) has the inscrnipotion ‘Ad
Gabinium! The Ode has nothing either to gain or lose by being ·
supposed to have had reference to any real personS.

The main image of the Ode 1s one, as Dillr. says, ‘in antiquitate
usitata, a nostris moribus aliena.²

5. οὴοαφ551,( is occupied with‚’ cp. the Greek phrases εἶναι περί.) g

expresses? 01· does he, while meaning ‘distinguet purpureo colore, ⁰ ·:
allow‘ purpureo colore' 35 3 matter of grammar and primary sense, ·
to go rather with‘ varius’ as a description of personified Autumn;
‘streaked with purple dyes‚’ like Epod. 2. 18 ‘decorum mitibut
pomis caput Autumnus agris extulit’? ‘¹ ⁷
13. ferox aetas. ‘ Her time of life makes her shy, and time iz
flying! To the rest of the sentence, ‘,’aetas in its general sense, ,
alone is the subJ'.; the epithet has no further relation to it. C.
Od. 1. 21. 7, 8‘ ni’gris aut Erymanthi silvis aut viridis Cragi,’ and ‹
