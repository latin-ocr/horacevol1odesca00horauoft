THE ODES OF HORACE

fabulae, the nominative; best explained by Persius’ imitation
(5. 152), ‘Cinis et manes et fabula fies‚’ ‘something to talk of,
a name and nothing more! There is nothing in it of Juvenal's

‘Esse aliquid Manis. ,Nec pueri credunt?

of Sestius’ present life, quoting Epp. 1. 6. 45 ⁴ Exilis domus est ubi -
non et multa supersunt’ 3 or, it may be ‘hollow,’ ‘unsubstantialss
like ‘levis turba‚’ Od. 1. 10. 18· , Virgil’s ‘domos Ditis vacuas et
inania regna,’ Aen. 6. 269.

18. regna vini, the post of συμποσίαρχος, ‘arbiter bibendi,’ ‘rex
mensae‚’ Macr. Sat. 2. 1 ; see Dict. Ant. s.v. ‘symposium’

talia, dice made of the knuckle-bones of some animal, ἀστράγαλοι,
Sat. 2. 7. 17 ‘mitteret in phimum talos.’ See on Od. 2. 7. 25 ⁴ quem .
Venus arbitrum dicet bibendi) It has also been understood as ⁴
=rot¹0v, ⁴ of such wine as this,' as if the poet pointed to his delicate
wines; but we could hardly say ⁴ regna vini talis ’ any more than we
could say ‘regna vini tui.’ So far as ⁴ vini' qualifies ⁴ regna’ and
forms part of one notion with it, it is general.

ODE V

‘WHO is the delicate stripling now, Pyrrha, that is wooing thee? ζ
Poor boy! disappointment is in store for him. Thy love is as the
sea, as bright and tempting, and as treacherous. I was shipwrecked .
on it once, but I escaped alive? ·

1. multa in rosa. It is doubted whether ‘in rosa’ means
⁴ crowned with roses' (cp. Od. 2. 11. 15 ⁴ rosa canos odorati capillos! ’.
Kiessling compareS, for the use of ‘ in,’ A. P. 228 ⁴ regali conspectus
in auro ⁹), or ‘on a couch of rose-leaves ’ (cp. Sen. Epp. 36. 9 ‘in
rosa iacere '). There is the same doubt as to the meaning of
⁴ potantem in rosa,’ Cic. de F in. 2. 20. 65.
4. oui=‘cuius in gratiam‚’ ‘for whose eye,' cp. Od. 3. 3. 25.
flavam, Od. 2. 4. 14, 3. 9. 19, 4. 4. 4. It possibly suits the name,

5. simplex munditiis, ⁴ plain in thy neatness‚’ Milton; but ,
‘ mundus ’ and ⁴ munditiae ’ carried a suggestion of trimness, refine-
ment, even daintiness: see on Od.3.29. 14, Sat. 2. 2. 55, Epp.

6. mutatos deos, the gods as the givers of happiness or pain· ,
