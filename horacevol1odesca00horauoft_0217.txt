nisi reddidisses,’ ‘while trying tofrighten you with threats of what
ζ he would do if you did not return the kine.' The tense ‘ reddidisses ’
' (instead of ⁴ reddideris ') is due to the historic present, ‘ terret‚'

 

which follows ‘ dum! Draga, Hist. Syntax, § 507, 1. A. β.

11. viduus risit, like ‘sensit delapsus‚’ laughed to find himself
robljeddjves' with his rich presents, ἀπερείσι’ ἄποινα, see Hom. Il. 24.
228 foll. Mercury‚ the best of thieves, is the best of guardians

J3 against theft, like Plato's δεινὸς φύλαξ φὼρ δεινός, Republ. p. 334 a.

15. ignis . . . iniqua, it was neither because they were not

watching‚ nor because they were friends, that he was able to pass
f* safely. ‘ Thessalos ignis‚' the watchfires of Achilles. Cp. Od. 2. 4.
10 ‘ Thessalo victore.’

17 foll. His functions as ψυχοπομπός. The ‘levis turba,’ the

, ‘ shadowy throng,' εἴδωλα καμόντων, are distinguished from the fewer

‘piae animae.'
17. reponis. The ‘re’ gives the idea, of ‘aside,' ‘out of the

· way,’ ‘in safety,’ ‘in repose.’ So Virg. Aen. 6. 655 ‘tellure re-

poitssoscoeroes, of keeping a flock together, preventing them straying
by the way, Oc’l. 1. 24. 18. Hermes carries ῥάβδον χρυσείην when he
drives the suitors' souls to Hades in Hom. Od. 24. 1 foll.

ODE XI

‘ Do not go to the Astrologers, Leuconoe. Better bear life as it
forne& enjoy the present, and think as little as possible about the
utute?

On the ‘mathematici' see Dict. Ant. 5. v. Astrolog ia; “genus
hominum potentibus infidum, sperantibus fallax, quod in civitate
nostra et vetabitur semper et retinebitur? Tac. Hist. 1. 22. Horace
himself was not above an interest in the superstition of the day, see
Od. 2.17, and Sat. 1.6. 113.

The name of Leuconoe is chosen doubtless in part at least as
a pretty sounding name which suits the Choriambic metre, as
Neobule and Liparaeus suit the Ionic a minore of Od. 3. 12. It 1s
possible also that Horace may have looked to its etymology, but
it is hard for us to say whether it would have conveyed a com-
plimentary sense or the reverse3 ‘candida' or ‘clara mente’ say
some of his editors, ‘empty- -minded’ say others. Pindar’ s λευκαὶ

φρένες, Pyth.4. 194, which is quoted m support of the latter view,
seems rather to imply‘ malignity' than‘ folly!

Metre-—Second Ascleptad.

1. ta, see on Od 1.9. 16. The use of the pronoun emphasizes the

prayer, ‘’Pray do not.'
