ODE XXIX

‘' WHAT‚ Iccius hankering after the treasures of Arabia, and
planning eastern conquests? Have'you chosen already your share
of the spoil? Who will say again that aught in nature is impossible,
when Iccius the scholar sells his library to buy armour and belies

“ the promise of his life ? ’

Iccius is unknown to us except from this Ode and Epp. 1. 12.
He is there described as a man of philosophical tastes and of
rigidly temperate lise. This Ode is playful. Iccius has conceived
(or talked of) a purpose of joining in the expedition led by Aelius
Gallus (as it turned out, unsuccessfully) into Arabia Felix in
B.c. 25, 24. Horace rallies him on the idea as unsuited to his
habits. The expedition itself is spoken of in terms which are
hardly seriouS‚ as if it aimed at the conquest of the whole East
(‘ horribili Medo,' ‘ sagittas Sericas ’), and Iccius' own part in it in
terms which must be banter. It is he who plans the war, who
carries chains for his captives ; he is to have the pick of the spoil,
a princess‚ a court page as a cup-bearer, &a

The same expedition is spoken of as projected in Od. 1. 35.

1. beatis, properly the epithet of the rich man, not of his riches3
γ but it contains a reference to the name of Arabia Felix.

nuno. Dillr. points out the emphasis laid on this word. ‘ What,
now, after a lifetime spent in such different pursuits 2 ’

Arabum gazis, Od. 2. 12. 24 ‘plenas Arabum domos ’; 3. 24. 1
‘Intactis opulentior Thesauris Arabum’; Epp. 1. 7. 36 ‘divitiae
Arabum.’ On the extravagant ideas of the Romans about the
wealth and treasures of Arabia, see Dict. Geog. s, v. Sabaei.

3. Sabaeae, the name of the most important city and tribe of
S. Arabia, the Σαβά, ‘ Sheba,’ of 1 Kings 10. 1.

4. Medo, a hyperbole, possibly of those who vapoured about the
expedition3 but it is in Horace's way, cp. Od. 1. 12. 56, 1. 35. 31.

5. quae virginum barbara, for ⁶ quae virgo barbara ’ or ‘ quae
virginum barbararum! Horace is fond of variations of the kind;
ep. Epod. 10. 13 ‘ Graia victorum manus'3 Sat. 2. 1. 61 ‘maiorum
ne quis amicus.' He is speaking of a princess‚ the ‘bellantis
tyranni adulta virgo’ of Od. 3. 2. 7.

7. puer ex aula, ‘a page from the court’; Liv. 45. 6 ‘pueri
regii apud Macedonas vocabantur principum liberi ad ministerium
regis electi! The phrase ‘ad cyathum stare’ occurs in Suet. Jul.
49. Compare Virro’s cup-bearet, ‘ Flos Asiae,' Juv. 5. 56, and the
fgncultusfipuer . . . non Phryx aut Lycius ’ of a humbler household,
i . 11. 14 .

9. doctus, &c.‚ i. e. ‘ a high-born boy,’ an archer like his fathers
before him. The purpose is to exalt the value of the page, not, as
some editors think, to frighten Iccius.
