THE ODES OF HORACE

36. perrupit Acheronta. For the lengthening of' the short
syllable, cp. Od. 2. 6. 14 ‘Angulus ridet, ubi'; 2. 13. 16 ‘Caeca
timet aliunde'3 3. 16. 26 ‘quidquid arat impiger! In all these
cases the metrical accent falls on the lengthened syllable. It is
noticed that this licence does not occur in the Fourth Book of Odes
nor in the Epistles. -

Herculeus labor, not without reference to the Greek βίη ‘H ρα-
κλείη, but as in all Horace’s imitations of the idiom, with a more
definite purpose and emphasis on the substantive. ‘ Labor’ does
not represent an inert or habitual epithet. ‘It was a labour of v
Hercules to burst the barrier of Acheron.’ Cp. Od. 3. 21. 11 ,
‘ Narratur et prisci Catonis Saepe mero caluisse virtus ’3 Sat. 2. 1.
72 ‘ Virtus Scipiadae et mitis sapientia Laeli.’

37. ardui. The gen. is supported by Horace’s custom, Epp. 2.
1. 31 ‘ Nil intra est oleam, nil extra est in nuce duri!

38. A proverbial impossibility, Pind. P. 10. 41 ὁ χάλκεος οὐρανὸς
οὔποτ’ ἀμβατὸς αὐτῷ.

4ο. iracunda fulmina, ‘the bolts of his wrath.’ The epithet
properly belongs to Jove himself, cp. Od. 1. 12. 59 ‘inimica fulmina ‘;
1. 37. 7 ‘ dementis ruinas.’

ODE IV.

THE lesson of the Ode is the same, though not so explicitly put,
as that of Od. 4. 7 ‘ Immortalia ne speres monet annus.' ‘ We have ⁷
spring once more, all nature is enjoying itself. Take thy fill of
pleasure, Sestius; for death, which comes to rich and poor alike,
will soon be here, and then no more pleasures.'

 

The Sestius to whom it is addressed is probably identified with
L. Sestius, son of the P. Sestius whom Cicero defended. He had

served in M. Brutus' army with Horace. Dion 53. 32 mentions it ἐξ

to the credit of Augustus, that he appointed Sestius ‘Consul {²⁴

suffectus’ in his own room in B.c. 23, although he was notorious ξ·
for preserving images of Brutus, and honouring his memory. 'f'
Kiessling suggests, with probability, that the position of Sestius
as consul in the year when the Odes were published explains the ζ
place given to the Ode as fourth in the Book. [J
The metre (Archilochium IVtum) is from Archilochus, Fr. 91 :—- ξ

οὐκέθ’ ὁμῶς θάλλεις ἁπαλὸν χρόα· κάρφεται γὰρ ἤδη,
ὄγμος κακοῦ δέ γήραος καθαιρεῖ.

1. solvitur, winter is a chain in which the world is bound. 4
‘Rura gelu . . . claudit hiems‚’ Virg. G. 2. 3173 cp. Od. 1. 9. 5
‘ dissolve frigus?

‘gr-'ata viee, ‘the pleasant succession.' Epod. 13. 7 ‘benigna
meze.- machinae, ‘ rollers,' such as 6those described by Caesar, B. G.
