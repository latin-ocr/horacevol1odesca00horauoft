I.—-THE CHRONOLOGY OF·THE ODES.

ξ 1. THE general period during which the greater number of the
Odes of Books i—iii must have been composed can be fixed with
some certainty. The earlier limz’t is fixed by the Battle of Actium.
Epod. 9 was written immediately after the victory, while even the
direction of Antony's flight was still unknown. Od. 1. 37 is written
on Cleopatra's death in the following autumn, Β. c. 30.

It is of course possible that some of the Odes may have been
composed before the Epodes were finished, but there is none that
bears any clear mark of it. In the absence of such proof the
presumption is against it: for Horace’s usual practice seems to be
to finish one collection of poems before he begins another. There
is development of style within one collection in the direction of the
next, but no appearance of overlapping. That the Epodes them-
selves were softening into something hardly distinguishable from
the Odes, and that some of the ‚Odes retain metres, or even the
tone, of the Epodes, makes it more difficult to understand why,
if particular Odes were written before 31, they were not included
in the volume of Epodes,

ξ 2. The second limz't, the latest date at which the Three Books
as a whole can have been published, is fixed mainly by the re-
ference in Od. 1. 12. 45-48. Marcellus died in the autumn of B.c. 23.
It is inconceivable that these lines should be (as 'Ritter suggests)
a complimentary allusion to one already dead; an assurance to
Augustus that at least the fame of his son-in·law survived ; all that
the author of the dirge on Quintilius could offer to match Virgil's
‘Tu Marcellus eris.’ And it is almost equally impossible that,
written before his early death, they should have been published
(as from other considerations it would be necessary to conclude)
