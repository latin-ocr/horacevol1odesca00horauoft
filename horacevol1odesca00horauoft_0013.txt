GENERAL INTRODUCTION

and the like, MS. testimony cannot be held to settle it absolutely,

ξ 2. Blandim‘us Vetustzksimus (V). Cruquius, a professor at ι

Bruges, in making preparations for his edition ¹, had had access to four
MSS. then extant in the Benedictine abbey of St. Peter ‘in monte
= Blandinio’ (Blankenberg) near Ghent. These MSS. all perished
(as he tells us in a note on the inscription to Book I of the Satires)
. in the sack of the abbey by a mob of Iconoclasts in 1566. His
own e‘stimate put thern all as early as the ninth century, and one
whose loss he especially laments he distinguishes from the rest as
s ‘vetustissimus.’ The readings which he cites from this constitute
the famous V, round which so much of the criticism on Horace’s
ξ’ text has turned.

j The general opinion of editors, from Bentley downwards, has
ἑ, attached very high value to these readings. Keller and Holder, on
¹ the other hand, consistently undervalue thern, placing the MS.
ᾗ, among the more interpolated, and even suggesting that some of
the better readings attributed to it were from Cruquius' own con-
jecture. Their treatment of the question has led to its careful
re—examination by several scholars. The most judicial discussion
Ι of it is that by R. C. Kukula ². While maintaining the good faith of
Cruquius and the general value of the readings, he draws attention to r
’- some important limitations to our use of his testimony. He points
out (1) that as the MSS. perished before any part of the edition
. except Odes IV was published, what we have to imagine is in the
main not an edition prepared with the ‘ vetustissimus ’ before him,
to be referred to again and again, but references to notes taken
’ some years before. (2) That to be of any value his quotation rnust

, been preceded by partial editions of Odes B. IV in 1565, Epodes in 1567,
