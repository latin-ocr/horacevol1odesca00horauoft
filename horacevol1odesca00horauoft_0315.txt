BOOK ΙΙ, ODE XVI, 17-39

32. hora.. Time in its course, one hour if not another; cp.

33. Grosphus has large pastures in Sicily. For this form of
wealth see on 1. 31. 5. Cp. Epod. 1. 27, Epp. 2. 2. 177.

33, 34. greges . . . mugiunt. If ‘ greges’ is to be distinguished
from ‘vaccae,’ according to the common opposition of ‘greges et
armenta,’ ‘ flocks and herds,’ there is an easy zeugma in the use of
‘ mugiunt! Possibly‚ however, ⁴ greges vaccaeque ’ = ‘ greges vac-
carum’ (cp. Epod. 2. 11· ‘mugientium greges ²), the two being
separated ·in order to give more emphasis to the numeral and
adjective.

34. For the elision cp. 4. 2. 22, Carm. S. 47.

l315. blis tinctae, δίβαφα, Epod. 12. 21 ‘ Muricibus Tyriis iteratae
ve era anae.'

Afro, Epp. 2. 2. 181 ‘vestis Gaetulo murice tinctas.’

38. spiritum Camenae, equivalent, as the commentators say,
to the ἰ’σα πνεῖν Μούσαις of the epigram on Sappho (Anal. Brunck.
p. 449) save that ‘ spirare' and ‘ spiritus ’ have a special reference,
which we do not know in πνεῖν, to the ‘thoughts that breathe and
words that burn’ of poetry. Cp. Od. 4. 3. 24 ‘Quod spiro et
placeo, si placeo, tuum est,' 4. 6. 29 ‘Spiritum Phoebus mihi,
Phoebus artem Carminis nomenque dedit poetae.’ See also Sat.
1. 4. 42-47‚ where the name of poet is limited to the man, ‘Ingenium
cui sit, cui mens divinior atque os Magna sonaturum,’ and it is
doubted whether comedy can claim to be poetry, ‘quod acer
spiritus ac vis Nec verbis nec rebus inest!

tenuem has no doubt a close relation to ‘ Graiae‚’ and describes
the polish and refinement of taste which Horace missed in the

. ’ earlier Roman literature. Cp. A. P. 323, where there is the same

antithesis as that hinted here between the delicacy of literary taste

. and the coarser Roman life with its love of wealth, ‘ Grais ingenium,'

&c. Ι t is difficult to say how much feeling of the metaphor remains
in either ‘spiritum ’ or ⁴ tenuem.' If this passage stood alone we
should have no difficulty in interpreting ‘ tenuem ’ of the fineness
and delicacy of the air, but ‘ tenuis,’ like the Gr. λεπτός and cor-

responding words in many languages, is used widely of nicety
· ofjudgement or taste or expression. Horace gives it in this sense
ζ another metaphorical connexion, Epp. 2. 1. 225 ‘tenui deducta

poemato filo! The rival interpretation of ‘tenuem spiritum ' as =
‘particulam aliquam exiguam spiritus' is not so good. Horace’s
farm is ‘ small,' but we do not want to continue the depreciation of
his lot, but to enforce the doctrine of the fair balancing of fortune
by contrasting his modest externa] means with the richness of his
mental ists, γ .

camegnae, used without scruple of the Greek Μοῦσαι. Cp.
‘Pindaricae Camenae,' Od. 4. 9. 8.

39. non mendax dedit, Carm. S. 25 ‘ veraces cecinisse· Parcae.’
