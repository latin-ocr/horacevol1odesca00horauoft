temporary defeat by the Sygambri in B. C. 16 see Introd. to this
Book. His character stands very low with other writers. Pliny,
N. H. 9. 35. 58, and Vell. Paterc. 2. 9, accuse him specially of
avarice and venality. This is in strange contradiction to Horace's
panegyfic, in which such stress is laid on his freedom from these
particular vices. The public voice can hardly, at the time Horace
wrote, have endorsed the accusations; or the boldness of meeting
Lollius’ calumniators on their own ground would have raised ridicule
rather than sympathy. Something no doubt must be deducted from
Velleius’ testimony on the score of his partiality to Tiberius, whose
enmity Lollius had specially incurred (Suet. Tib. 12, 13), and Pliny
would very likely have followed Velleius. But Lollius, notwith-
standing the failure of his German campaign, continued in the
intimacy and confidence of Augustus, as is shown by the fact that
he was sent by him to the East as the companion and adviser of his
grandson Caius Caesar in B. c. 2. The issue of Lollius’ campaign on
the Rhine had not been unsuccessfu13 and it is likely enough that
Horace would rush to the rescue of a friend of his own and of the
emperor's, against whom, in the moment of what may have seemed
a single and undeserved failure, the world had begun to breathe
graver charges, possibly such as were subsequently shown to be
true, but such as his friends in Rome could still discredit.

1. ne forte eredas; not a direct prohibition, in which sense
Horace would rather say ‘ ne credideris’ (see on 1. 33. 1), but as
in Epp.1.1. 13 (‘Ac ne forte roges quo me duce, quo lare tuter:
Nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri, Quo rne cumque rapit
tempestas, deferor hospes’ ; cp. Sat. 2. 1. 80), giving the negative
purpose of the following statement. ‘ To prevent your fancying, as
perhaps you might, that my poetry will die, let me remind you of
the fame ofother lyric poets.’ The preamble serves to connect the
discourse on lyric poetry with the stanzas about Lollius personally.
‘Lest you should undervalue an Ode from me, 1 will proceed
“pretium dicere muneri '’.'

2. longe sonantem3 3. 30. 10 ‘qua violens obstrepit Aufidus‚’
4. 14. 25 foll., Sat. 1. 1. 58. ad Aufidum must not be pressed too
closely. The Aufidus was ten miles from Venusia.

3. non ante vulgatas per artis: the plural, of the rules of an
art. ‘Vulgatas,' rather ‘known to the world,’ in its productS, than
‘ divulged' as secrets to a special artist3 but there is intended to
be a certain mystical air about the words, a suggestion of the meta-
phor of 3. 1. 2, 3 ‘ carmina non prius Audita Musarum sacerdos,’ &c.
The words qualify the whole clause ‘ quae natus ad Aufidum.
verba loquor,’ &c., ‘verba socianda chordis' being merely a peri-
phrasis for lyrical poetry, and there being the usual antithesis
between his birthplace and his claim. It is Latin lyric poetry
which he professes to have invented, or popularized, as he puts it,
when he is speaking more responsibly in Epp. 1. 19. 24 ‘Ostendi
Latio. ..vulgaviss
