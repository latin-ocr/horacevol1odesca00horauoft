THE ODES OF HORACE

68. coniugibus loquenda. lt is hard to say whether this is to
be taken of their own wives, ‘for their wives to tell of‚’ i. e. in
pride3 or of the Carthaginians’ wives, ‘ which only wives will live
to tell of,' the husbands being all slain. The latter gives a more
definite climax to the stanza ; but it must be allowed that if this is
the meaning, we should have expected some word to imply either
that the ‘ wives' would be widow5, or that their ‘ talk ’ would be by
way of mourning. Catullus puts the idea more distinctly‚ ‘ Illius
egregias virtutes claraque facta Saepe fatebuntur natorum in funere
matres,' 64. 348.

69. iam non . . . superbos 3 as after Cannae. Cp. Livy's account
of Mago’s mission to Carthage to announce that victory, and carry
the proof of it in three bushels of gold rings taken from Roman
knights, 23. 12.

72. Hasdrubale interempto; Liv. 28. 12.

73—76. It is a question whether the stanza is a continuation of
Hannibal’s speech or the poet’s summing up. The latter is more
likely. A quiet ending of the Ode is part of Horace's art (see
Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 11. 3), but he would hardly put into
Hannibal's mouth a dull prophecy of the glories of the house of
Ner0. It is pretty certain, also, that Ritter is right in supposing
that the ⁴ curae sagaces ’ belong to Augustus. Cp. 4. 14. 16 and 32
⁴ Te copias, te consilium et tuos Praebente Divos! Horace’s
intention is to unite the praises of the emperor with those of the
young Neros. Here the compliment is intensified by the conjunc-
tion of his protection and that of Jupiter. This is the only
interpretation which will give the last line and a half sufficient
weight to balance the line and a half which precede.

73. perficiunt. This was the reading of V, though most other
good MSS. have ‘ perficient.’ When once the stanza was taken as
ahprpphecy, there was an obvious motive for altering the tense to
t e uture.

76. acuta belli, the difficulties, anxieties of war. Cp. ‘aspera
belli,’ Liv. 6. 32. Perhaps there is an image of a ship threading
the sharp rocks which beset a channel. For the use of ‘ expediunt'
cp. Virg. Aen. 2. 632.

ODE V

‘ TOO long already, Augustus, art thou absent from thy trust.
Return, then, remembering thy solemn promise. Thy face is
spring to the year and brightness to the day. As a mother
watches for her sailor—boy's return, so Rome for her Caesar. To
thee we owe security by land and sea; peace and plenty; the
restoration of honesty and of pure morals. No fear of Parthian
or Scythiam of German or Spaniard. From morn till night a man
works in his own vineyard, and then goes home to thank thee
