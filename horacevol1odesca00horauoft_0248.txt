THE ODES OF HORACE

pretender, as though his name were enough, ‘ who would care what
a Tiridates is frightened at ? ’ The references seem to be the same
as in Virg. Georg. 2. 496 ‘infidos agitans discordia fratres, Aut
coniurato descendens Dacus ab Istro '3 cp. also Hor. Od. 3. 8. 18

Α ιὰ-ιῐ ...ιιι

‘ occidit Daci Cotisonis agmen, Medus infestis tibi luctuosis dissidit -

armis.’ The ⁴ rex’ then of v. 4 is Cotiso, king of the Dacians, north
of the Danube, who had at some time made himself formidable by
descergts across the river. For Tiridates, see Introd. to Odes
i—iii, 8.

5. unice, though every one else is full of these questions.

6. fontibus integris, ἃς. Α second reminiscence (see Od.
1. 7. 7) of Lucr. 1. 926 ‘iuvat integros accedere fontis Atque
haurire; iuvatque novos decerpere flores,’ &c. Observe how
Horace combines the two claims for his poetry‚ ‘integris,' ‘novis

fidibus,’ and yet ‘ Lesbio plectro’3 cp. Epp. 1. 19. 21 ‘ Libera per ‘

vacuum posui vestigia princeps, Non aliena meo pressi pede . . .
Parios ego primus iambos Ostendi Latio’; see on Od. 1. 1. 29.
He only claims originality in imitation.

9. Piplei, from the fountain Piplea in Pieria. This is the read-

ing of Porphyrion. If we retain the MSS. ‘ Piplea ’ we must suppose γ

that Horace uses it as an adj„ of the Muse who haunts the spot.

mei honores, ‘honours that Ι can give’3 cp. Pind. Nem. 9. 21 ,

ἐπασκήσω κλυταῖς ἥρωα τιμαῖς.
11. sacrare, to canonize, to give the immortality which so many
stout hearts have lacked for want of a ‘vates sacer,' Od. 4. 9. 25.

ODE XXVII

IN Od. 1. 18 the poet had recommended moderation in the use of

wine on moral and religious grounds. Here his object is the same ζ
though the tone is lighter. The Ode is a dramatic sketch of a Ι

banquet which is degenerating into a drunken brawl. Horace

interrupts it by an appeal, playful in its mixture of the Bacchic j
hierophant with the genial poet os good living. The company ³·

would reply to their monitor by filling his glass. ‘ On one condition·
only,’ he says, and diverts them at once from his own lecture and
their rising quarrel to an absorbing interest in the love affairs
of Megilla' s brother, his bashfulness, his imagined confidences, his
mysteriously hopeless fate.

Athen. x. p. 427 A preserves part of a poem of Anameon, which
may have inspired the beginning of this Ode:—

ἄγε δηῦτε (al. δεῦτε) μηκέθ’ ουτω
παπ-(ἔγω τε κάλαλητῷ

Σκυθικὴν πόσιν παρ’ οινῳ
μελετῶμεν ἀλλὰ καλοῖς·
ὑποπίνοντες ἐν ὕμνοις.
