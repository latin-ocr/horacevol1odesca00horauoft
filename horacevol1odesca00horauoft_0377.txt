ODE XVII

COMPARE Introduction to 1. 26. The purpose of this Ode can
only be guessed. The introductory passage seems as if it was
playful. It traces Aelius Lamia's pedigree to Lamus, the Homeric
king of the Laestrygones (Od. 10. 81 Ἕβδομάτῃ δ’ ἱκόμεσθα Λάμου
αἷπύ πτολίεθρον Ι Τηλέπυλον Λαιστρυγονίην. Cp. Cic. ad Att. 2. 13
‘ si vero in hanc Τηλέπυλον veneris Λαιστρυγονίην, Formias dico, qui
fremitus hominum 1²), whose locality was fixed by the Romans in
the neighbourhood of Formiae. Possibly, although he throws it
on the public voice (‘ferunt,’ v. 2), Horace may be inventing
a mythical ancestry for Lamia, as Virgil does for the Iulii, Sergii,
Cluentii, &c.‚ as Cicero does playfully for himself (Tusc. 1. 16. 38
‘regnante meo gentili,' sc. Serv. Tullio), and as was done on
a large scale in Varro's lost work, De Familiis Troianis. The
Lamiae, though not famous in the ages of the Repubhc, were
a prominent family under the Empire. Juv. Sat. 4, 154 ‘Hoc
nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti‚' in allusion to L. Aelius Lamia
Aemilianus, put to death by Domitian. Cp. ib. 6. 385.

Horace writes the day before a holiday, possibly to Lamia at
some country house which belonged to him near Formiae. This
would give an additional point to the mention of the sea-shore and
to the genealogical introduction, as if the poet had meant to say,
‘You are a great man at Formiae at least, in the home of your
heroic ancestor.’ ,He professes to foresee a rainy day, and bids
Lamia use the dry weather to house his wood and prepare for
to-morrow’s festival. The connexion of thought we may compare
with 1. 9. That Ode will show, however, that it is not necessary,
from the mention of the sea, to suppose that Lamia was at Formiae.
In both probably the stormy weather, if not actually allegorical, is
used to enforce a moral beyond that which appears on the sur-face.
The one other certain reference to Lamia in Horace’s poems (Od.
1. 26), and another probable one (Ep p. 1. 14. 6), suggest to us that
he was a man before whom his friend would desire to set the
sunny side of life.

Vv. 2-5 have been condemned by many critics, with no support
from external evidence3 but the Introduction as their omission
would leave it would not be more free from difficulties than the
unmutilated one.
