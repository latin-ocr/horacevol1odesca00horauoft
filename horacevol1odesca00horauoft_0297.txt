year 25. Augustus was then at Tarraco, in Spain, detained by
illness; and during that time we are told (Mommsen, Res Gest.
Div. Aug p. 133, Orosius 6.21. 19) an embassy from the Scythae
(Geloni v. 23) came to him. He was offered by the senate a
triumph for victory over the Cantabri and Salassi. Dr. Gow
thinks that‘ nova tropaea’ refers to an actual monument of victory,
such as the arch still standing at Aosta which Mommsen identifies

with one named by Dion (53. 26) as having been erected at this .

time, or that which gives its name to Turbia over Nice. The
double triumph over East and West so emphasized by Virgil‚ will
mean the triumph over the Cantabrian as following the triumphs of
29 over enemies to the East of Rome.

1. hispidos, predicative: of the roughened and tangled look of
the country after rains, opp. to Virgil's ‘ nitentia culta.’

3. inaequales, ‘gusty,’ or, perhaps, ‘ roughening’3 cp. ‘ inaequa-
lis tonsor‚’ Epp. 1. 1. 94. ’

5. stat, we should rather say ‘ lies,’ ‘ stands stiff and deep.’

iners, 1. 22. 17 ‘ pigris campis?

7. Gargani, a rocky promontory at the north-east corner of
Apulia. Cp. Epp. 2. 1. 202 ‘ Garganum mugire putes nemus.'

9. tu semper. The absence of any adversative particle to mark
the antithesis is supplied by the emphatic use of the pronoun
and the repetition of‘ semper 'fromv. 1, see on 4.4. 17. Notice
also the emphatic position of ‘ semper? v. 1, ‘usque,' v. 4, ‘sssemper
v.17.

urges, Prop. 4. 11. 1 ‘Desine, Paule, meum lacrimis urgere
sepulchrum.’ ‘Urgere’ adds to some simple metaphor, such as
‘prosequi,’ the idea of perseverance.

11. surgente, used inaccurately of the stars coming into sight
at night, as in Virg. Aen. 4. 352‘ quotiens astra ignea surgunt.’

12. rapidum, ‘striding, ’ helps the metaphor of ‘fugiente’
Horace probably had in mind Virgil’s ‘Te veniente die, te de-
cedente canebat,’ G. 4. 465.

13. ter aevo functus, ‘who lived life three times over,' seems
(like Cicero'‘s tertiam [Nestor] iam aetatem hominum vivebat, de
Sen. 10) to be an exaggeration of the Homeric ἤδη δύο μὲν γενεαὶ

contemporaries. The old age of Nestor, which needed the support
of a son, would have excused his grief, as would the ‘loveable'
character of his son. The story of Antilochus’ death, as he was
defending his father, is told m Pind. Pyth. 6. 28 foll.

15. impubem. His youth is meant to add to the pathos,‘1n-
felix puer atque impar congressus Achilli,' Virg. Aen. 1. 475.

16. Troilon. His death does not occur within the period of the
. Iliad. it is just mentioned by Priam, Il. 24. 257. Virgil (Aen. 1.
