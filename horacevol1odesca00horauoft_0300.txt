THE ODES OF HORACE

7. invidenda, as Od. 3. 1. 45 ‘invidendis postibus,' in the same
connexlon.

9—11.ingens, celsae, summos, all in emphatic positions, ‘ for
their height. ' Cp. Herod. 7. 10 ὁρᾷς τὰ ὑπερέχοντα (&a‘ ms· κεραυνοῖ 6
θεὸς οὗδὲἔ ἐᾷ φαντάζεσθαι, τὰ δὲ σμικρὰ οὐδέν μιν κνίζει; ὁρᾷς δὲ“ ως ἐς
οἷκὴματα τὰ μέγιστα αἰεὶ καὶ δένδρεα τὰ τοιαῦτ’ ἀποσκήπτει τὰ βέλεος

11, 12. Dr. Verrall recalls Seneca's quotation (Epist. 19) from
the ‘Prometheus’ of Maecenas,‘ ipsa altitudo attonat summa,’
which Seneca himself links to this Ode by quoting in the same
connexion ‘ contrahes vela!

13. infestis, secundis, ablatives absolute.

17. male, sc. ‘est,' Od. 3. 16. 43, Epp. 1. 1. 89, ‘bene est!

18. quondam, ‘sometimes.’ ‘Quondam etiam victis redit in
praecordia virtus,' Virg. Aen. 2. 367.

19. areum, the bow with which he inflicts death, plague‚ &c., as
in Hom. Il. 1. 49, 382, &c. Cp. Carm. Saec. 33 ‘Condito mitis
placidusque telo.’

21. angustis, ‘in straits of fortune.' This metaphor seems to
suggest the return to the metaphor of the first stanza‚ good fortune
being the οὖρος before which we run fast and free.

22. appare, ‘ show yourself.’

23. nimium, with ‘secund0,’ ‘ dangerously favourable,’ δυσ-

οὖριστον.

ODE XI

‘Do not trouble yourself with foreign politics, Quinctius, nor
with schemes of business. Life wants very little, and it is flying ,
fast. spring flowers die and moons wane. Do not weary yourself
over pians as if things remained for ever. Better crown with roses
our hairs already whitening with age, and drink and play while we

may.’

Nothing is known of Quinctius Hirpinus; possibly he is the .
same as the Quinctius to whom Epp. 1. 16 is addressed.

The nature of the name ‘ Hirpinus’ is not certain. It is very
probably a local name (as ‘Marrucine Asini,' Catull. 12. 1), the
Hirpini being a· Samnite tribe, of which Beneventum was the

capital.

1. bellicosus, Od. 2. 6. 2,3. 8. 21, 4. 14. 41. cp. Virg. G. 3. 408
‘impacatos Hiberos.’ Notice that ‘bellicosus' really applies to J·
‘Scythes’ also, and ‘divisus Hadria’ suggests a parallel ‘divisus

Tyrrheno mari 'for the ‘Cantaben’ See on Od. 2. 10. 6, 8, 2. 15. ζ

18, 20.
2. Hadria divisus, a reason for not troubling ourselves about ·
him, ‘ the broad barrier of Hadria is between us.’
3. remittas, with infinitive, ‘forbear,' as ‘mittere,’ Od. 1. 38. 33
‘omittere‚’ 3.29. 11.
