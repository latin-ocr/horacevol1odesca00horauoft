THE ODES 'OF HORACE

non adytis . . . incola Pythius. It seems best to take this as

a slight inversion, after Horace's manner, for ⁴ adytis Pythiis incola‚' {3
‘not in his shrine at Pytho the god who dwells there'3 comp.

Epod. 10. 12 ‘ Graia victorum manus' for the more usual ‘Graiorum.'
For the mode of describing the god, comp. Virg. Aen. 3. 11 1 ‘ mater

cultrix Cybelae.’ Possibly ‘incola ' may have a stronger force, and f

represent Pindar’s οὐκ ἀπόδημος τυχών (Pyth. 4. 7), ‘when his pre·

sence is there '; with reference to the migrations of gods from one ‘

shrine to another.
adytis is opposed to the more widely diffused afflatus, ἐνθου-

σιασμός, of Cybele or Bacchus.

7-9. non aeque . . . non sie . . . ut. It has not generally been ς’
noticed that there are two points of comparison between anger and ,ἰ

the possession of some god; (1) that they both make men lose ·

their balance of mind, (2) that they find expression in senseless

‘⁶ss

noise. This last comes home especially to the present case: Horace
suggests that his lampoon was only an instance of ‘sound and f]
fury signifying nothing‚’ like the tinkling cymbals of the frantie 1'
Corybantes. Grammatically, ‘ut’ answers both to ‘non aeque' :

and to ‘ non sic.’ In each case, if the sentence were completed as

in prose, something should be added to give a predicate to ‘ tristes ς
irae' which would suit it more exactly than ‘geminant aera' or p
even than ‘ quatiunt mentis sacerdotum! Bentley proposed to read
ex conj. ‘si' for ‘sic‚’ constructing as Od. 2. 17. 13 ‘Me nec ἵ

Chimaerae spiritus igneae, Nec si resurgat centimanus Gyas,
Divellet umquam,’ and his reading is followed by Dine, Keller, ’.ἓ

Kiessling, but if the explanation given above is right the alteration ⁷

will damage the sense.

9. tristes, ‘ill-omened,’ ‘odious.’

irae, ‘ bursts of passion.’

Noricus, Epod. 17. 71. Noricum, the modern Tyrol, Styria‚
Carinthia, was famous for its iron, Plin. N. H. 34. 41.

10. deterret, frightens from their purpose.

naufragum, actively, as Virg. Aen. 3. 55 3 ‘ navifragum Scylaceum!

12. Iuppiter ipse ruens, cp. Od. 3. 3. 7 ‘Si fractus illabatur
orbis Impavidum ferient ruinae.' The expression here contains a
remembrance of Ζεὺς καταιβάτης, though the thought is not so much
(as it is in the Greek) of the thunderbolt, as of the vault of heaven
cracking, ‘ruit arduus aether,' Virg. G. 1. 324, of the lightning,
thunder, and rain3 for ‘Iuppiter’ of the sky, cp. Od. 1. 1. 25.

13 foll. The legend of Prometheus does not appear in this form
in extant Greek literature, see on Od. 1. 7. 21 and Epod. 13 Introd.
He is the creator of man in the myth of Plato's Protagoras.

13—16. The simplest construction is to take ‘addere' after
‘coactus,’ ‘apposuisse’ aster ‘fertur‚’ giving to ‘et’ the sense of
‘etiam,' ‘a150,’ ‘among the rest.’ It has been proposed also to
supply ‘ esse’ with ‘ coactus,' ‘fertur coactus esse . . .et apposuisse’3
cp. Tac. Ann. 1. 65 ‘visus est . . . obsecutus . . . et 1·epulisse.’

13. fertur is a usual word in introducing a legend or story which
