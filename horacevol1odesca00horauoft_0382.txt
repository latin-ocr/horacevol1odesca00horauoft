THE ODES OF HORACE

with reference to the Greek proverb ἢ πέντε πίνειν ἢ τρὶ’ἦ μὴ τέτταρα,
an uneven number being held in itself more suited to any sacred
purpose (ι numero deus impare gaudet ⁹), and three and its multiples
especially. The epithet therefore would in thought be extended to
the Graces. It explains the choice given between three and nine.

14. attonitus, of the pangs of inspiration. Cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 580
‘attonitae Baccho matres.’ ”
ξ 16. rixarum metuens; 3. 24. 22 ‘metuens alterius viri’; Madv.

289 a.

Gratia iuncta sororibus = ‘tres Gratiae iunctae' ; so 4. 7. 5.

18. Cp. 2. 7. 28, 4. 12. 28.

Berecyntiae3 1. 18. 13, 4. 1. 22, Epod. 9. 5. 6.

24. vicina, ‘our neighbour! Others take it as ‘his neighbour, ³

who will not listen to his passion ’ς and Orelli quotes Bosscha as
suggesting that the person meant is the Rhode of the next lines,

‘ She doesn’t care for Lycus, but she will soon be here to look for ν

Tegipggsbss-lr· remarks how the repetition of ‘ Lycus ’ and of ‘ te’
serves the purpose of emphasizing them, the one by way of scorn,
the other of compliment.

26. puro, as ‘sole puro,' 3. 29. 45, shining in a clear sky. Cp.

3. 9. 21 ‘ sidere pulchrior!
27. tempestiva, suited in point of age.
28. lentus; 1. 13. 8.

ODE XX

‘ BEWARE, Pyrrhus; you are robbing a lioness of her cubs. She

will come to reclaim Nearchus, and you must expect a battle royal; ,

and all the time Nearchus doesn't care for you or for her?

2. Gaetulae3 see on 1. 23. 10.

3. post pau10=‘ paulo post' even in prose. Dillr. points out the <

antithetical arrangement of the words ‘ dura . . . inaudax,’ ‘ inaudax
raptor’: the last has the force of an oxymoron. ‘ Inaudax’ seems
an invention of Horace from the Gr. ἄτολμος.

6. insignem, easily found among them all.

7. grande certamen. We need not understand ‘est’ or ‘ erit’3
it is rather a cognate accusative characterizing the action of the last
sentence by giving its result, a construction common enough in
Greek. Dillr. collects some other instances of it in Latin: Sat.
1. 4.)1{30‚6lg.pp. 1. 18. 49, Virg. Aen. 6. 223 (where see Conington’s
note ‚ . 3.

7, 8. tibi . . . illi. The supposed difficulty of this clause as ,it
stands has caused such different editors as Orelli, Keller, and
Kiessling to accept Peerlkamp’s emendation of ‘illa' for ‘illi,’
‘whether the prey fall to you or she [prove] the stronger.' But
is the difficulty real? We may well say that the whole clause is
