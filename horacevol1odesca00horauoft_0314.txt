THE ODES OF HORACE

disappointment daunts us. ‘ Brevi ’ answers to ‘multa’ Life is
too short for many aims; the metaphor of ‘iaculamur' is that
of the Gr. τοξεύειν, Soph. O. T. 1196, διε.

18, 19. Cp. Virg. G. 2. 512 ‘Exilioque domos et dulcia limina
mutant Atque alio quaerunt patriam sub sole iacentem? where
Virgil uses ‘ muto ' with the accusative of that which is surrendered ;
Horace uses it of that which is taken, but suppressing the other
object of exchange. Compare the uses of ἀλλάττειν, as Soph. Ant.
944 οὐράνιον φῶς (‘ to quit ⁹), Eur. Hec. 483 ”Αιδα θαλάμους (‘ to
enter' . ’

19. inan-iae exsul, Greek genitive, as φυγὰς· ”Αργεος, Theoc. 24.
127, imitated by Ovid, Met. 6. 189 ‘ exsul erat mundi,' 9. 409 ‘ exsul
mentisque domusque! For the sentiment cp. Lucr. 3. 1060-1070,
Hor. S. 2. 7. 113 foll., Epp. 1. 11. 27 ‘ Caelum non animum mutant
qui trans mare currunt,' 1. 14. 15 ‘In culpa est animus, qui se non
effugit unquam.’

21—24. Cp. 3. 1. 37 foll. ‘Timor et Minae Scandunt eodem quo

dominus, neque Decedit aerata triremi et Post equitem sedet atra—

Cura.' The image of the ship grows naturally in both passages out
of what precedes. ‘ It is of no use running away to other lands (in
3. 1, to your seaside villa) ; care goes on board with you.' ‘ Aeratas
navis,' ‘aerata triremi,’ seem to hint that care might have been
expected to stand in awe of a rich man’s well-appointed trireme
(cp. Epp. 1. 1. 93 ‘ conducto navigio aeque Nauseat ac locuples
quem ducit priva triremis ’). The same additional idea is probably

contained in the ‘ turmas equitum,' into which the simpler ‘ equitem ’'

of 3. 1. 40 is expanded in this Ode. Horace probably had in mind

Lucretius’ account (2. 46) of the bold front with which ‘curae . . . -

sequaces . . . Nec metuunt sonitus armorum nec fera tela, Audacter-
que inter reges rerumque potentis Versantur.’ At the end of the
stanza both images have merged in the general idea of the im·
possibility of flying from care which is fleeter than a stag or a
storm-wind. -

21. vitiosa, ‘morbidff The adjective rather interferes with the
Ι personification‚ but it is Horace’s manner, see on 1. 35. 21 ‘ Spes et

albo rara Fides colit Velata pann0.'

25. ‘When happy in the present let the heart shun all care sor
what is beyond; when the cup is bitter‚ sweeten it with the smile
of patience.'

quod ultra est, τὰ πόρρω, the ‘ future?

26. lento rim, ⁴ the smile of patience ⁹ Cic. de Or. 2. 190 ‘ lenter

ferre '3 Tac. Ann. 3. 70. 3 ‘lentus in suo dolore esset.'

29. Achilles had his choice; cp. Hom. ΙΙ. 9. 412 Εἰ μέν κ’ αὖθι
μένων Τρώων πόλιν ἀμφιμάχωμαι, Ι ὤλετο μέν μοι νόστος, ἀτὰρ κλέος
ἄφθιτον ἔσται· 1 εἷ δέ κεν οἴκαδ’ ἵκωμι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν, Ι ὤλετό
μοι κλέος ἐσθλόν, ἐπὶ δηρὸν δέ μοι αἰὼν Ι ἔσσεται. - ⁷
