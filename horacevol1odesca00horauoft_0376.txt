THE ODES OF HORACE

28. Cp. the similar oxymoron in Sat. 2. 3. 142 ‘Pauper argenti
positi intus et auri.'

29. Cp. the description of his farm, Sat. 2. 6. 1 ‘modus agri non
ita magnuS, Hortus ubi et tecto vicinus iugis aquae fons Et paulum
silvae super his? So also Epp. 1. 16. 1—14.

30. segetis certa fides. The opposite is ‘fundus mendax,’
3. 1. 30. Cp. Virg. G. 1. 225 ‘illos Exspectata seges vanis elusit
aristis (avenis).’

31. Constr. ‘fallit beatior sorte (λανθάνει ὄλβιωτέρη ouon) fulgentem
fertilis Africae lmperi0,’ ‘is a lot happier than his, though heb cannot
see it, who glitters in the lordship of fertile Africa! This seems to
be a hyperbolical way of describing a man who owns wide corn-
lands in Africa, as another is said in v. 41 to ‘ join in one sweep the
kingdom of Alyattes to the broad plains of Phrygia.’ Cp. 2. 2.
10—12 ·’ 5ἱ Libyam remotis Gadibus iungas et uterque Poenus Serviat
uni‚' and read with this the note there. Ritter takes ‘fertilis
Africae ' with ‘ sorte,’ comparing ‘Sors Asiae ’=‘ the proconsulship
of Asia‚'Tac. Ann. 3. 58 and 71, ‘is a happiness beyond the pro-
consulship of rich Africa, though he cannot see it who is in the
dazzling light of power’ (‘fulgentem verum latere facilius potest
quod dignitatis splendor oculos praestrinxit ’). But m this rendering,
if stress is to be laid on the glory of power, we lose the force of the
epithet ‘fertilis' and of the dilect comparison with the poet' 5 few
acres and certain crops. If we emphasize ‘feltilis' as implying
that the proconsul of Africa has the opportunity of enriching
himself, ‘fulgentem imperio’ loses much of its meaning. The
metaphors grow to a great extent out of the context. ‘ F ulgentem
imperio' is an echo of ‘dominus splendidior': ‘regnum Alyattei ²
&c.‚ as an exemplification of ‘ vectigalia porrigam‚’ is suggested by
the proverbial wealth of Croesus.

33 foll. Cp. the enumeration of the forms of Roman wealth in
1. 31. 3—12.

33. Calabrae apes, 2. 6. 14.

34. Laestrygonia, from Formiae. Cp. 1. 20. 11, and see Introd.
to the next Ode. For the local epithet given to the ‘amphora’
instead of the wine cp. 1. 9. 7 ‘ Sabina diota. ’

35. languescit, ‘mellows'3 3. 21. 8‘ languidiora vina?

pinguia- = ‘spissass Pliny distinguishes the white wool of Cis-
alpine Gaul, ‘Circumpadanis nulla praefertur‚’ H. N. 8. 48.

39. ‘I shall better extend my little revenues by narrowing my
desires! Note the verbalcontrast between‘ contracto' ‘porr’igam.
This interpretation is amply proved by Horace’ s use of‘ vectigalia’
in Sat. 2. 2. 100, and the current Stoic aphorism (Cic. de Rep. 4. 7,

Parad. 6. 3)‘ magnum vectigal parsimonia! For ‘porrigere' = ‘to κ’

extend? cp. Sen. Epp. 89ι Quousque arationes vestras porrigetis?’
41. Alyattei, the father of Croesus. The wealth of the kings
of Lydia was proverbial, 2. 12. 22. ‘Alyattei' is the genitive of
‘Alyatteus,' as ‘Achillei‚’ ‘Ulixei,' Epod. 17. 14 and 16. It is
a certain correction of Bentley’s, the MSS„ oldest and la'test alike‚
