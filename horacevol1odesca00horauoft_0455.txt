BOOK IV, ODE XIV, 50-——ODE XV, 28

was opened in time of war and closed in time of peace, was ‘Ianus
QuirinuS‚' ‘ Quirinus ' being apparently an adjective, as in ‘ Ianus
Geminus,' ‘Ianus Iunonius,’ &a It is open therefore to suppose
either that the genitive was used indifferently with the adjective
as = ‘of Romulus' (to whom the worship of Janus was attri-
buted), ‘of Rome‚' ‘Romam' or that Horace consciously varies
the usual form, as he does technical expressions so often; see on
3. 5. 42.

10. frena licentiae iniecit3 3. 24. 29.

12. artis. For the use of the word cp. 3. 3. 9 ‘Hac arte
Pollux,' &c., and Sall. Cat. 2. 4 ‘Imperium facile his artibus
retinetur quibus initio partum est.’ They are the virtues of old
Roman life celebrated in 3. 1—6. As Kritz explains on the passage
in Sallust, the word only = ‘ studia ac mores,' and must draw its
positive colour from the context. If the end proposed were bad,
>⁴ artes ' would be vices.

14. imperi3 see on 1. 2. 26.

15. ortus. There is a v. l. of less authority, ‘ ortum' It is a
case clearly where either singular or plural is admissible‚ and
where variety is quite a sufficient motive to account for their inter-
change. Bentley quotes Sall. Cat. 36‘ cum ad occasus ab ortu
solis omnia domita armis parerent)

17. eustod03 3. 14. 15‚4. 5.1.

18. exiget, in its simple sense, ‘drive out,‘ as 2. 13. 31 ‘exactos
tyrannos?

20. miserae, prolepticallyf to their misery?

inimicatst sets at variances a word, apparently, as Porph. tells
us (‘ fictum verbum est '), coined by Horace.

21. For the form of expression see on 3. 10. 13 cp. 2. 20. 20
‘Rhodani potor.' The peoples meant may be either the Vindelici
(4. 4. 18), against whom Tiberius had won some victories, or the
Daci (3. 6. 13, Virg. G. 2. 497 ‘coniurato descendens Dacus ab
Histro ’), who used to be spoken of as dangerous in the early years
of Augustus’ reign.

22. edicta Iulia. We must no more look for a technical mean-
ing in ‘ edicta,‘ than for exact historical facts to correspond with
the general statement. ‘Edictum,’ though limited very much in
use to the praetor‘s edicts, was a general term for any command
issued by a magistrate. The form of the phrase is intended to
recall ‘leges Iuliae,’ the name which covered the domestic legisla-
tion of Augustus as well as Julius. The substance, so far as it
had any which can be realized, would be terms of peace, which
Augustus has imposed on the various nations.
