THE ODES OF HORACE

tergeminis. ‘ Tergemini ’ properly meant ‘three born at a birth:
as ‘ gemini ⁹ (Plaut. Amph. 1. 2. 28 ‘ duos geminos ⁹) by usage meant
two so born. Afterwards it was used generally for ‘triple‚’ cp.
‘ centumgeminus ⁹ (Virg. Aen. 6. 287), &c.

honoribus, the abl. as ‘Cl. Marcellum pontificatu . . . extulit‚’
Tac. Ann. 1. 3. Some difficulty seems to have been early felt in
identifying the ‘ three offices‚’ for the Schol. explains ‘ finitus nume-
rus pro infinito, vel etiam aut quaestura, aut praetura aut consulatu.’
The ref. is to the ‘ certus ordo magistratuum‚' which were ordinarily
the offices of quaestor, curule aedile, praetor, consul. The ‘three ’
may be the three last, as the three ‘ curule’ magistracies; or the
first and the two last, the office of aedile being not unsrequently
omitted. In the comparison in Cic. Mur. of the careers of Murena
and Sulpicius the only three offices through which they are traced
are those of quaestor, praetor, consul.

9. proprio horreo. Cp. 3. 16. 26 ‘si quidquid arat impiger
Apulus Occultare meis dicerer horreis.’ ‘To store in his own
granary all that is swept up from the threshing-floors of Libya,' is
one of the metaphorical descriptions of the passion for enormous
properties of which there are so many in Horace. See the later
stanzas of that Ode, and 2. 2. 10 foll.

11. gaudentem, ‘one whose pleasure it is.’ The point of the

following lines is the tenacz·ty·with which men cling to their own ζ

pursuit3 so the instance taken is no longer the lordly owner of
a ‘latifundium' in the provinces, but the humble cultivator of an
‘avitus fundus,’ 1. 12. 44.

findere sarculo. The verb and the implement seem to imply
difficult and personal work; a harsher soil as well as a smaller
farm. Contrast ‘ scindere’ and ‘proscindere,’ used of ploughing,
and compare Virg. G. 1. 94 ‘rastris glebas qui frangit inertis.’

Kiessling quotes Plin. N. H. 18. 19 ‘montanae gentes sarculis ⁷

arant.’

12. Attalicis condicionibus, ‘ by offers such as Attalus could .

make? An allusion to the proverbial wealth of the kings of Perga-
muS, see on Od. 2. 18. 5. For the use of ‘condicio,’ cp. Cic. ad
Q. Fr. 1. 1. 2 ‘ ut nulla condicio pecuniae te . . . ab summa integritate
deduxerit.’

13. cypria, Od. 3. 29. 60 ‘ Cypriae merces!

14. Myrtoum. ‘ Speciem pro genere ponit more suo,’ Porph. on
Od. 1. 16. 4. So with ‘ Cypria,’ ‘ IcariiS,' διο. When Horace puts
a special for a general designation in this manner he usually selects

a Greek one. F our names are commonly assigned to different parts ⁷

of the Aegean: Thracium, the northern part: Myrtoum, the

western part, south of Euboea, so named from the small island '

Myrto‚ off the south coast of Euboea: Icarium, to the east of
Myrtoum, named from the island Icaria, just west of Samos:

Cfrg‘z'cztcm (Od. 1. 26. 2), south of both the last, washing the island

16. metuens, ‘at the moment when he fearS.’ His repentance
