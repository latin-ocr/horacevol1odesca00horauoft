THE ODES OF HORACE

the ‘tu’ appears with the second clause. So Epp. Ι. 2. 63 ‘hunc
frenis, hunc tu compesce catenis’ ; so in Greek σύ γε.

17. virenti, Od. 4. 13. 6 ‘virentis Chiae’ ; Epod. 13. 4 ‘dumque
virent genua’ ; so a hale old age is called ‘ viridis senectus!

18. areae, the open spaces in Rome, especially round temples,
so that we hear of the ‘ area Concordiae,’ &c.

20. composita, ‘the hour of tryst'3 Juv. 3. 16 ‘ubi nocturnae >

Numa constituebat amicae?

21 foll. ‘ Now too the sweet tell-tale laugh from the secret corner
that betrays the hiding girl'; ‘repetatur' is understood from the
last sentence. Compare the lover's play in Virg. E. 3. 63 ‘ Et fugit

ad salices et se cupit ante videri? Dillenburger calls attention to ξ

the symmetrical arrangement of the adjectives and their substan-
tives: ‘latentis puellae,' ‘ proditor risus,’ ‘intimo angulo ’3 ‘puellae ’
seems to depend ἀπὸ κοινοῦ on ‘ proditor ¹ and ‘ risus.’ -

24. male pertinaci. Probably==‘faintly resisting.’ She is not A
sorry her lover should get the ring or ribbon. ’ἱ

ODE X

‘HYMNUS est in Mercurium ab Alcaeo lyrico poeta‚’ Po'rph.
Pausanias, 7. 20, mentions a hymn to Hermes by Alcaeus, and that
it contained the story of his theft of the oxen. Among the frag-
ments of his poetry (Fr. 3 Bergk) there is what seems to be the
first line of a Sapphic Ode to Hermes :—

χαῖρε Κυλλάνας ὁ μέδεις, σὲ γάρ μοι.

The Ode is a study‚ and doubtless an imitation, not a translation,
frolidnegcffglds, identified with the Greek Hermes, is celebrated as the
teacher of language3 of the palaestra; of the lyre; of craft, theft
included ; as the herald, πομπαῖος, on earth and below it.

Compare Ovid, Fast. 5. 663—692 ‘ Clare nepos AtlantiS,’ διε.

1. facunde, λόγιος is a frequent epithet of Hermes; so he is the
mouth-piece of the gods, ‘ interpres Divum.’ -
8 nepos, as the son of Maia ‘quam Atlas generat‚' Virg. Aen.

141. Ἰ

3. voce formasti, comp. Horace’s account of man before the
invention of language, Sat. 1. 3. 100 ‘mutum et turpe pecus? =

catus, ‘by thy wit’ ;,Varro L. L. 7. 46, says that it is a Sabine ι
word meaning properly‘ sha1·p.’ .

decorae,‘ grace· giving.

4. more, ‘'‘rule, institution! Pind. Ol. 6. 126 τεθμὸν ἀέθλων.

7. callidum condere, for inf. see App. 2. §2.

9. olim, so ‘'puerum in the next line, ‘long ago,’ ‘when still
a mere boy.’ It was on the very day of his birth according to the
Homeric Hymn εἷς Ἑρμῆν, 2ο. The construction is ‘dum terret
