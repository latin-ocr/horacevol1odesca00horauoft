seilicet, ‘this is the end of the whole matter? The thirst for
money, which can never be satisfied‚ is the cause to which Horace
traces the cheating of the father and the gambling of the son,
and in it he returns to the lesson of the Ode, of the first line as of
the last.

nature of wealth, which for ever grows, yet comes no nearer to

ODE XXV

IN this Ode, as in 2. 19, Horace has trie‘ed to catch the inspiration
of a Greek dithyramb. In that one he professes to recall the
effects which the sight of Bacchus had upon him: in the present
one he is actually under the influence of the afflatus. ‘He is
hurried away, whither he knows not: his eyes are opened on
strange caverns and river-banks and woods. His tongue will be
loosed in a moment to sing no humble theme, and in no common
strain‚ the glories of Caesar: he follows the god, for he must3 and
it is delightful, but it is fearful too.’

The glory of Caesar is only mentioned as the subject of the
coming burst of song3 but the place of honour given to it is in
effect the celebration which is promised. See 1. 6, Introd.
