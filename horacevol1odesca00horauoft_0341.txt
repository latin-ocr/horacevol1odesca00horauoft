BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE III, ADDITIONAL NOTE—ODE IV

for a special reason, because there was or had been a special risk*
of its infringement. The resemblance cannot be accidental between
this Ode and the stanzas of the Carmen Saeculare in which (vv.
37-48) the same close relation and essential difference between
Troy and Rome are dwelt upon: Rome represents not the whole
of Troy, but the ‘remnant,’ the descendants and imitators of the
‘ castus Aeneas, patriae superstes! Rome, Horace would say, has
had its long career of greatness because the condition has been

’ complied with: the old vices, ‘Laomedonteae periuria Troiae,’

Asiatic perfidy, luxury, greed of treasure, have not broken out
again. Why does he say so at this moment? The most likely
answer seems to be that he is thinking, in part at any rate, of the
rival regime from which Augustus has saved thern. It is a thought
on which we know that he dwelt‚ the orientalizing of the Roman
empire which was threatened if the victory at Actium had fallen to
Antony and the ‘ mulier peregrina ¹.’ The six Odes would fail to
set out all the grounds on which Horace accepted the rule of
Augustus and recommended it to his countrymen if this one was
altogether omitted.

ODE IV

‘ CALLIOPE, aid me in my song. Is it a delusion‚ or am I already
among the Muses, hearing and seeing them? I am their favourite.
In my childhood the wood—pigeons covered me with leaves when
I was asleep on the hillside, and through life the Muses have given
me a special protection. For their love I escaped Philippi, and
the falling tree, and shipwreck off Palinurus. And they are Caesarfs
solace and refreshment too· , They give him gentle counsels, and
he accepts them. We allv know how Jove’s bolt swept away the
brutal Titans; for all their strength of arm, and piled mountains
and uprooted trees, they could not stand against Pallas and the
gods who ranged themselves around her. F orce without mind ·
falls of its own weight ; force, under control, the gods advance and
protect. The giants are in Tartarus, and will never be released.
Lawless lust is punished with endless chains.'

This Ode deals with the side of the imperial regime which did
most to attract and hold fast such adherents as Horace himself.
The Muses themselves ‘gave gentle counsels to Caesar.’ It was
the regime of moderation‚ of refinement, of literary culture. Those
who still continued to conspire against this gentle rule were as the
giants trying to overthrow the Olympian gods, and restore the
dominion of insensate force and lawless lust. But force without
wisdom was powerless.

¹ Mommsen allows that in this and other phrases of vv. 20-26 Horace is
glancing at Cleopatra and her paramour.
