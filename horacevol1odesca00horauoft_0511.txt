INDEX oF METREs

ς (2) The Dalctylic Hexameter‚ followed by an Iambic Trimeter,
E o . 16.

The Iambig verse in this· metre consists entirely of pure Iambics.

8. A couplet known as the Greater Sapphic, from the likeness of
the rhythm of both verses to the Common Sapphic verse. The
first line (which goes by the name of Aristophanes) is a Sapphic
without the initial trochees. The second is a Sapphic, with a
choriambus inserted before the dactyl :—

-υυ-υ-Ξ,

-υ---υυ--υυ-υ--Βη
It occurs in Od. 1. 8.
9. Hipponacteum Od. 2. 18.
A couplet consisting of a Trochaic Dimeter C atalectic‚ followed

by an lambic Trimeter Catalectic :—

-υ-υ-υΞ,

Ξ-υῇΞ-υ-υ-ξ

10. Ionicus a minore, Od. 3. 12.
This is composed entirely of the foot called ‘ Ionicus a minore ' 2-

de—-.

The metre is described by Hephaestion, who takes as his type
an Ode of Alcaeus, of which the first line, which he quotes, seems
as if it may have been the original of Horace’s Ode (see Introd. to
Od. 3. 12). It is not, he says, as it may easily be taken to be, an
unbroken succession of similar feet, but broken into periods of ten
feet each. Bentley pointed out that Horace’s Ode consists of forty
feet, i. e. four such periods, and held that the arrangement in lines,
which many editors debate, was merely a necessity of the writer or
printer‚ and not to be elevated into a law of the metre.

ξ 6. Α few words may be added on what is called by some
editors ‘Meineke's canon.’ He noticed that, with two exceptions,
all the Odesl of Horace contain a number of lines which is
a multiple of four. Of these, 3. 12 has just been discussed. It has
been arranged by some persons in stanzas of four lines (see Excurs.
on it in Orelli's edition); but it might fairly be contended‚ either
that the nature of the metre consisting not of verses, but of feet,
exempted it from the common category, or that, inasmuch as it
consists of four periods of ten feet each, it complies with the same

· conditions as other Odes. The other exception is Od. 4. 8, which

contains thirty-four verseS. It so happens that this Ode already

l The law is not applied to the Epodes, the very name of which (see

pfa351) probably implied an arrangement in couplets rather than four-line
s nzas.
