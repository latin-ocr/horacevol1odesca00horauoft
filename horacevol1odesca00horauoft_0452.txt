THE ODES OF HORACE

in poetical language and in works of art (see Orelli's and Ritter‘s
notes). Eur. Ion 1261 ὦ ταυρόμορφον ὄμμα Κηφισοῦ πατρός, Virg. G,
4. 371 ‘ Et gemina auratus taurino cornua vultu Eridanus‚’ Aen. 8.
77 ⁴ Corniger Hesperidum fluvius regnator aquarum. ' It is a dis-
puted question whether the original idea was of the horn- like
branchings of a river, or of its violence, or of its roaring3 μεμυκὼς

ἠυτε ταῦρος, Hom. 11. 21. 237, of the Xanthus. Cp. ‘longe sonans,’ .

of the Aufidus, 4. 9. 2. But whatever was its origin, Horace pro-
bably feels the image suggested by the epithet through the following
. lines3 so that there is almost a simile within the simile. Tiberius
is like the Aufidus in flood: the Aufidus is like a bull charging
down the mountain side.

26. Dauni Apu1i3 3. 30. 10.

praefluit3 4. 3. 10.

 

28. meditatur. The good MSS. are divided between this word ’.ἑ

and‘ minitatur) Porph. read‘ meditatur, and Servius quotes it to
illustrate Georg.3. 153 ‘Minitatur'is the most likely to have
been a gloss. The true answer to Porph.' s criticism ‘male dixit
medztatur quia in ipso actu est nec debet cogitare aut condiscere
quod iam facit,' seems to be that the image is not of the river
actually flooding the lowlands, but of the boiling waters of its upper
course filling its channel to the brim, and threatening a flood to the
lower levels.

30. diruit. This verb, more commonly used of laying buildings
in ruin, is justified here, on the one side, by the image of the river,
ὅς τ’ ὦκα ῥέων ἐκέδασσε γεφύρας (Hom. l. C.); on the other, by the
epithet of ‘ agmina, ’ · the ‘steelclad lines' are looked at as fortifi
cations which were to be levelled.

31. primos et extremos, all alike, first rank and last rank.

metendo; Virg. Aen. 10. 513 ‘proxima quaeque metit gladio.'

’ In Hom. ΙΙ. 11. 67g it isacomplete simile: οἱ δ’, ὥς τ’ ἀμητῆρες ἐναντίοι
ἀλλήλοισιν Ι” ογμον ἐλαύνωσιν, κτλ.

32. stravit humum, ‘strewed the ground) The ablative of
the harvest with which he strewed it, is to be gathered from

‘’metendo, ἃς.

sine clade, i. e. without loss of his own troops; v. 13. There is'
this force also in the preceding metaphors ε the enemy went down
before him like corn before a mower.

33. Horace returns to the praises of Augustus. With eonsilium
cp. 4. 4. 75 ‘curae sagaces!

copias 3 see above v. 9.

34. divom v. 16 ‘ auspiciis secundis.' The ‘ auspicia’ belonged
to the emperor: it was his ‘felicitas ’ that was in question. Tiberius
and Drusus were only his ‘legati.'

tibi, quo die, &c. The meaning is, that this war was brought to
an end just fifteen years after Augustus’ victorious entry into
Alexandria. This took place on the Kalends of August, Β. C. 30.
Whether we are to press the words ‘ quo die ’ to mean on the very
same day of the year, there is nothing to determine.
