the little images of your gods, and there is no need for more.
&Vithout any gifts but the salted cake you may win their favour, as
much as by a sumptuous victim.’

‘ The gods accept the humble offerings of humble people. Mod-
eration‚ simplicity‚ thrift, content with our own station, have place
in religious observance as well as in other phases of life.’ This
is all the doctrine of the Ode. The name Phidyle (Gr. fem. of
Φειδύλος, see Lidd. and Scott, s.v. φειδός), is clearly chosen to
characterize a ‘ thrifty’ Sabine housewife.

176 ‘tendoque supinas Ad caelum curn voce manus! The hands
were held open with the palms upwards. ‘Supinas ferre manus ’
might be = χεῖρας ἀνασχεῖν, and be a common way of saying ‘to
pray’: possibly, in combination with the other particulam, ‘nas-
cente Luna‚' ‘ ture,’ ‘ horna fruge‚' &c. it helps the idea of punctual
ritual performance.

Ovid, speaking of sacrificing a pig to Ceres (F ast. 1. 349), makes
its greediness the ground of its fate ε ‘ Nam sata vere novo teneris
lactentia sucis Eruta setigerae comperit ore suis! But the pig
does not offend the Lares in this way. The epithet is intended
probably to help the feeling of the familiarity of the object, and so
the simplicity of the offering.

8. grave tempus, ‘the sickly time when the year bears its
fruits.’ For the ablative see 2. 7. 16 ‘fretis aestuosis.’ With

ness of autumn cp. Od. 2. 14. 15, Sat. 2. 6. 19.

‘nivali ’ here. Cp. 4. 4. 57.

where the destination of the different calves is settled immediately
on their birth ε ‘ Aut aris servare sacros aut scindere terram!
