THE ODES OF HORACE

15. bimi. New wine was used in sacrifices, cp. Od. 1. 31. 2,
3. 23. 33 ‘bimi ' will therefore probably mean ‘last year's wine,’
which would be used till the wine of the year was ready.

meri, wine with any admixture of water was unfit for religious
uses.

16. veniet lenior, opposed to ‘in me tota ruens‚' v. 9. The
overpowering and painful ‘ afflatus ³ of a god was a sign of dissavour
rather than of favour, and would be mitigated by submission and
reverence. See Od. 2. 19.

ODE XX

AN invitation to Maecenas to visit Horace at his Sabine farm,
where he will have not indeed the Caecuban or F alernian which he
drinks at home, but Sabine wine; if cheap, yet carefully bottled by
Horace himself, and carrying in its date a pleasant reminiscence of
Maecenas' life, viz. of the rounds of applause with which 110 was
received on first entering the theatre after an illness.

On the date of this Ode, see Introd. to Odes i-iii. ξ 8.

Compare the tone of the Ode with Epp. 1. 5.

1. modieis. As the wine will be cheap, so the cups will be

modest3 whether in make and material, or in size‚ is doubtful.

Small cups would mean that it was not a drinking bout. Cp. Sat. ,

2. 6. 70 ‘ [poculis] modicis uvescit laetius‚’ and 2. 8. 35 where the

hard drinker ‘ calices poscit maiores? There is the same doubt 111 ’

Epp. 1. 5. 2 ‘modica patella.’

2. cantharis. A handled cup, old-fashioned, and traditionally
associated with Bacchus, cp. Virg. E. 6. 17 ‘ gravis attrita pendebat
cantharus ansa‚’ where it belongs to Silenus: Plin. N. H. 35. 53

‘C. Marius post victoriam Cimbricam cantharis potasse Liberi ,
patris exemplo traditur.' Horace names it among his table furniture, .
