still more definitely for ‘the beloved ’ in Virg. E. 3. 68 ‘ Parta meae 1

Veneri sunt munera.’

15. ‘ The passion with which she fires thee need raise no blushes.’ ³

16. que. Dillenburger draws attention to Horace’s use of ‘ que ’

in such a case, where the first clause having a negative form an ‘s

adversative conjunction would be more usual 3 cp. 2. 12. 9, 2. 20. 4,
3. 30. 6, and see on Epod. 15. 14.

semper, ‘ always,’ and so I am sure now.

17. Whisper to me, if you will not tell it to all the company.

19. laborabas. There seems to be no doubt that this is the true
reading. ‘ Laboras ’ is found in a few good MSS. and supported by
Porph., but the hiatus is filled in no MS. of any authority. The
imperfect represents the Greek ἄρ’ ἐπόνεις, ‘you are labouring all

the time! It is of a new discovery, and refers to the time before

the discovery was made3 see on Od. 1. 37. 4.

Charybdi. Compare the lines of Anaxilas, the comic poet,
quoted by Athen. 13. p. 558 ‘H δὲ Φρύνη τὴν Χάρυβδιν οὐχὶ πόρρω που
ποιεῖ; Ι τόν τε ναύκληραν λαβοῦσα καταπέπωκ’ αὐτῷ σκάφει. Cicero
says of Antony ‘ Quae Charybdis tam vorax,’ Phil. 2. 27. 67.

21, 22. saga . . . magus . . . deus, a climax.

21. Thessalis, Epod. 5. 21, 45.

22. venenis, a translation of φαρμάκοις, of magic potions.

23. triformi. Hom. Il. 6. 181 πρόσθε λέων, ὄπιθεν δέ δράκων, {
μέσση δέ χίμαιρα. Bellerophon, according to the post-Homeric ’

legend, killed the monster with arrows from the back of the winged

horse Pegasus. The ablative ‘ Chimaera' is governed, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ, ,Δ

by ‘illigatum' and ‘expediet,’ see on Od. 1. 3. 6.

ODE XXVIII

‘DEATH is common to all. That thought should make us quick ’
to recognize the duties imposed on us by our common humanity.’<-. j,
Though the Ode is not free from difficulties, this seems to be its ζ

general purport.

There are two parts in it. In the first some one is addressin
the philosopher Archytas, whose tomb <if we read the Ode right

philosopher. It is the doom even of those who seem most nearly ‚a

to escape the common lot of man. It is the end even of your own
master, the great Pythagoras, teach as he may the transmigration

of souls. The ways of death are many, but the fact of death is one ³·

and the same to all.’

In the second part an unburied corpse lying on the seashore
appeals to a passer-by for the boon of the triple casting of earth
upon it, which was necessary in order that the shade might cross
the Styx and find rest in Hades. The urgency of the appeal
