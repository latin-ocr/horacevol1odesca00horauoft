THE ODES OF HORACE

exact meaning. The majority of the older MSS. have ‘lyrae,’
‘tibiae‚' but V is with those which read ‘lyra,' ‘tibia.’ In that
case they are ablatives, constructed probably with ‘delectabere,’
though they also may be taken after ‘ mixtis.' Against the ablative,
there is the unpleasantness, to our ears at least, of four verses out
of five ending with a long ‘a.’ If we read ‘ae,' there is still
a question both of construction and sense. Are ‘lyrae,' ‘tibiae'
genitives aster ‘ carminibus,' ‘ mingled strains of harp and flute’;
or datives‚ as Orelli thinks, after ‘ mixtis ’Ξ And in this last case
does ‘carminibus’ mean the joint strains mingled, as we should
rather say ‘ of ’ than ‘with’ the harp and flute, or are ‘ carmina’
the voices of singers to be added to the instrumental music? More Α

ODE II

‘As vain for any of us to imitate Pindar as to soar on wings of

supreme alike in dithyrambs, hymns, ἐπινίκια, θρῆνοι. He soars on
the winds, the swan of song; 1 fiy from flower to flower, like the
bee of my native Apulia, and roam from wood to wood gathering
my little store of poetic honey. Some day, Antonius, when Caesar
comes home, some greater poet, such as you, must sing his triumph
-Caesar, the best and greatest gift which heaven ever gave to
earth, even in the golden age, our joy at receiving him back, our
