ODE VI

‘ HEROIC exploits require a Homer to sing of them‚’ says Horace,
v and so gives Agrippa the lyric glory that (it would seem) he has
asked for, while professing to leave the task of celebrating such
⁴ exploits to the epic genius of Varius. For panegyric cast in the
same form compare Od. 2. 12 and 4. 2.

The Ode is addressed to M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the friend and
counsellor of Augustus, and the greatest commander of his reign.
He finally defeated Sextus Pompeius at Naulochus in Β. c. 36, and
commanded at Actium in B-C. 31. After the death of Marcellus
(and consequently, it would seem, after the publication of this Ode)
he was married by Augustus to his daughter Julia (B. C. 21); was
associated with him (B.c. 18) in the Tribunitian power, and was
looked upon as his intended successor. He died four years before
Horace, in Β. c. 12. Horace speaks of his popularity in Sat. 2. 3.
185 ; of his subjugation of the Cantabri in Epp. 1. 12. 263 of his
engineering exploit of turning the Lucrine lake into a harbour,
though without mentioning his name, in A. P. 63.

by the Schol. to have borrowed two lines from that poem) which
would have contained the exploits of Agrippa,—but ===-· ‘scribaris

is used of poetical description, cp. v. 14, Sat. 2. 1. 16.
