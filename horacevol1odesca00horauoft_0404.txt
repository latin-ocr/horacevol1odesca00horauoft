THE ODEs OF HoRACE

‘cantabimus’3 or ‘ea,' sc. ‘dicetur ’? In any case, probably, it is
not intended to limit to Lyde the song addressed to Venus.

14. fulgentis3 1. 14. 19.

15. oloribus. For Venus' car drawn by swans see 4. 1. 10.

16. Nox3 3. 19. 10.

nenia, not necessarily a mournful song, as we see from Epp. 1.
1. 63 ‘puerorum nenia.'

ODE XXIX

THE Ode begins with an invitation to Maecenas to visit the poet
apparently at his Sabine farm. ‘Everything is ready for his re-
ception. Why does he delay, look out of his window on the distant
country, yet stay amid the grandeur and discomforts of the city?
Change is pleasant, even from luxury to simpler life. It smooths

the brow of care. The dog-days are beginning: in the country Α

they are thinking only of getting into the shade and to the river-
banks. Maecenas is still full of his cares for home and foreign
politics.’ Here Horace takes a wider sweep, and expresses with
some dignity his philosophy of life, such as it is. ‘The future is
purposely hidden from us. Live in the present; make the best of
it, you cannot control or foresee anything else. This is αὐτάρκεια,
and happiness. If you have really tasted life to-day, you may defy
Jupiter himself to rob you of that pleasure. Fortune delights in
changing men’s outward condition: the philosopher is independent
of her. 1f his outward happiness is shipwrecked, he can get ashore
unharmed himself.²

,1. Tyrrhena regum progeniem see on 1. 1. 1. The corre-
spondence is perhaps not accidental, but intended to help the
feeling that he comes back at the end of his task to the theme with
which he began it-his patron: ‘prima dictus, summa dicendus,
Camena.’ That Maecenas was proud of his Tuscan ancestry, and
that his friends were in the habit of setting it in relies against the
sels-chosen humility of his rank in Rome, are the explanation of
Horace’s selecting this special form of expressing his friend’s state
and greatness. ‘ My great friend' is the natural address, when the
poem is an invitation to him to exchange the weary pomp of his
city life, for the humbler country pleasures of the poet’s home. For
the hypallage cp. ‘ Graia victorum manus,' Epod. 10. 12.

2. verso. The ‘cadus’ or ‘amphora’ had to be tipped to pour
its contents into the ‘ crater’ which was set on the table.

4. tuiS, ‘expressly sor you’: in the same way ‘non ante verso
lene merum cado,' wine which has not been opened, but left year
