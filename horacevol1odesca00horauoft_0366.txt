THE ODES OF HORACE

13. comitesque, to be taken with ‘ducere,’ so that the adjective
covers ‘tigris' as well as ‘silvas'3 see on 1. 2. 1, 1. 5. 6, and for
the position of ‘que' on 1. 30. 6. The reference in the following
lines is to the story of Orpheus; cp. 1. 12. 8foll.‚ 2. 13. 33 foll„
Virg. G. 4. 481 foll.

15. immania. It is a question whether the adj‘ective agrees
with ‘ ianitor,’ as Virg. Aen. 6. 400 ‘ingens ianitor,’ or with ‘ aulae?
Orelli is probably right in preferring the latter, as ‘ aulae' seems to
want an identifying epithet. Cp. Sil. 2. 551 ‘insomnis lacrimosae
ianitor aulae.’

blandienti3 Od. 1. 12. 11, 1. 24. 13.

17—20. This stanza has been condemned, as an interpolation, by
Buttmann, Meineke‚ G. Hermann, Haupt, and others, both on
account of its dull expansion of the idea of ‘immanis ianitor aulae,’
and specially on account of the unemphatic use of ‘eius‚' of which
Bentley had previously complained. This is found in Ovid (Trist.
3. 4. 27), and in Horace’s Satires (2. 1. 70, 2. 6. 76). In the only
other instance of the word in the Odes (4. 8. 18), it is strongly
demonstrative. Virgil does not use it at all. The expansion‚
however, is (as Jahn points out) quite in Horace’s way (cp. 1. 12.
26-32, 2. 4. 9-12, 3. 4. 61—64, C. S. 41-44), and the details of horror
all make it a stronger instance of the power of music. Bentley
{vould remove part of the difficulty by reading for ‘eius atque’

exeatque.'

20. ore trilingu13 see on 2. 13. 34 and 2. 19. 31.

’ 21. Tityosque3 see on 2. 14. 8. For the number of ‘ risit' see
on 1. 3. 10.

22. invito, ἀγελάστῳ, it was not naturally inclined to smiles.

26. inane . . . pereuntis, answering to one another, ‘empty,
gecause the water always ran away.’ For the genitive see Madv.

290 e, note.

27. dolium is the vessel full of holes which it is their hopeless
task to fin. ‘ Urna,' in v. 22, is the smaller pitcher with which
each draws water for the purpose.

pereuntis has both the original meaning of ‘flowing through‚’
and also the common meaning of ‘vanishing,' ‘being wasted.’
There is the same double sense in Lucr. 1. 250 ‘ pereunt imbres’3
262 ‘ non igitur penitus pereunt.’

28. sera, ὖστερόποινα. >

30. nam quid, &c. He justifies the exclamation ‘impiae,’ and
then repeats it.

potuere, repeated with a play on the double sense of ‘posse,’ to
be able in respect of physical power, and to be able in respect

of heart and will; the first εέδυνήθησαν, ‘the second = ἔτλησαν. Β

For the second sense cp. Epod. 9. 14 ‘miles spadonibus Servire
rugosis potest.’
31. duro. For the meaning of the epithet cp. v. 45 ‘saevis
catenis,’ and see on Epod. 5. 30, Od. 4. 4. 57.
34. periurum, because he had betrothed his daughters to the
