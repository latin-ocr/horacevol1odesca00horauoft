BOOK 1, ODE v111, 8—ODE IX, 16

Compare Epod. 13 with its sudden change to the singular number
in v. 6, as though he were addressing the master or the ‘ruler of the
feast‚' ‘Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo! The whole

poem presents a strong resemblance in thought and expression.

1. stet, a natural word to use of a solitary hill which ‘ stands up '
or ‘rises’ out of a plain ; but possibly from its position it is here
meant to describe rather the depth and firmness of the snow‚ as
Virgil’s ‘ pulvere caelum stare,’ Aen. 12. 407, of a thick and palpable
cloud of dust ; as we should say, ‘ stands deep in snow.’

2. Soracte, Virg. Aen. 11. 785, hod. ‘ Monte S. Oreste '; a moun-
tain of Etruria, 2420 feet high, about twenty-six miles north
of Rome. Its striking outline, separated from the main range of
the Apennines by the broad Tiber valley, makes it a conspicuous
feature 1n all northern views across the Campagna.

4. aeuto,‘ piercingss Virgil's‘ penetrabile frigus,' G. 1. 93.

5. dissolve. The frost' 1s a chain that binds man as well as the

³· earth and streams. Od. Ι. 4. 1 ‘ solvitur acris hyems.’

6. Ῑὲἱθροῃοηε, piling, laying again and again. The participle is
erun ial.
g 7. deprome. The verb is used both of ‘ bringing out ’ wine from
the ‘apotheca,' or other place of storing‚ Od. 1. 37. 5 ‘depromere
Caecubum Cellis avitis’3 ancl of ‘drawing it off ’ from the ‘am-
phora,' or some larger vessel‚ as in Epod. 2. 47 ‘promens doli0.'
'Ibhe latter sense seems to be given to it here by the addition of
‘ eni mus.

qugdrimunn four years was a fair time to keep wine of the kind

Sabina. Wine from a Sabine jar= Sabine wine, cp. Od.3. 16.
34 ‘Laestrygonia amphora.' Sabine wine was not among the
better kinds, but it was such as Horace would drink himself,
Od. 1. 20. 1, and he supposes the person whom he addresses to
have means such as his own. ‘ A fire and some wholesome country
wine are enough to keep out the cold.’

8. diota, probably the same as the ‘amphora.’ Both names
refer to the two handles or ears.

9. Epod. 13 ‘Cetera mitte loqui: deus haec fortasse benigna
Reducet in sedem vice. ’ ‘ Make the best of winter, its storms will
cease when the gods will, and spring will corne back.' There is
certainly there, and probably here also, a suggestion of a winter and
spring of fortune, cp. Od. 3. 29. 43 ‘Vixiz cras vel atra Nube
polum pater occupato, Vel sole puro.'

simulz‘ simulac?

11. deproeliantis, see on Od. 1. 3. 13.

13. fuge quaerere, Od. 2. 4. 22 ‘fuge suspicari'3 Epp. 2. 2. 150
‘ fugeres mirarier!

14. luero appone, ‘ set it down as clear gain.'

16. neque tu, ‘nor, pray,’ calls especial attention to the prayer
which follows, so Od. 1. 11. 1 ‘tu ne quaesieris.’ Here Horace’s
prayer is represented as becoming more urgent as it goes on,
