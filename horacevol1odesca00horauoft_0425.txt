BOOK IV, ODE IV, 44-66

59, 60. The subject of ‘ducit' is ‘ gen5‚’ but here, as commonly
in Horace (see on 1. 35. 19, 2. 2. 1, 4. 2. 7), the interpretation can-
not shake itself clear of the language of the allegory. ‘For every
bough it loses, for every cut the knife gives, aye, from the very
edge of the steel itself, it draws fresh power and spirit? ‘Opes’
and ‘animus,’ or ‘animi‚’ were joined in this way almost pro-
verbially, Virg. Aen. 2. 799, Caes. B. G. 7. 76.

61. The stanza has been pronounced an interpolation by Meineke
and other critics, on the ground of its introduction of mythological
lore, which seemed to them frigid, and such as we find rather in
Propertius and in the Alexandrine poets. Horace possibly had
in mind the saying of Pyrrhus recorded by Florus, 1. 18 ‘Video
me (inquit) plane Herculis sidere procreatum, cui quasi ab angue
Lernaeo tot caesa hostium capita de sanguine suo renascantur.’

firmior. The adjective is more appropriate to the resolution of
the Roman people, and the firm front of their legions, than to the
hydra; but, in reference to it, it would seem to be antithetical to
‘ secto corpore,' and to mean ‘sounder’ ; when he slashed its body
it faced him in a moment entire as before.

62. vinei dolentem, ‘ chafing at the foil,’ Conington. It is the
measure of the unexpected persistence of the foe.

63. monstrum, of the armed warriors that sprang from the
dragon's teeth, sown by Jason in the furrows which the fire-
breathing bulls had ploughed (Ov. Met. 7. 121 foll.), or by Cadmus
at Thebes (Ov. Met. 3. 24 foll.). So new soldiers seem to spring
from the earth for Rome.

submisere ; Lucr. 1. 8 ‘tellus submittit flores.’

Colchi, of the country, as ‘Sabini,' 3. 4. 21, ἃς.

64. Echioniae, in reference to the particular story, for Echion
was one of the five of the Sparti who survived the mutual slaughter3
Ov. Met. 3. 126.

65. merses, ‘plunge it if you will? For the construction cp.
Epp. 1. 10. 24. Many of the good MSS. (including B) have the
corruption ‘mersus,' which, as Bentley points out, is impossible,
since ‘gens' must be the subject. Ritter thinks this line and the
next have a definite historical reference to the disasters of the
Romans by sea in the First Punic War, and on land in the Second,
and their subsequent recovery in each case. With the thoughts of
the stanza compare the sayings attributed to Hannibal by Livy
(27. 14), ‘ cum eo nimirum hoste res est qui nec bonam nec malam
ferre fortunam potest. Seu vicit, ferociter instat victis: seu victus
est instaurat cum victoribus certamen,' and by Justin. 31. 6 ‘ cum
Romano seu occupaveris prior aliqua seu viceris tamen etiarn cum
victo et iacente luctandum esse.’

66. multa eum laude, ‘amid loud applause,’ of a seat in a
wrestling match. Itis also taken with ‘integrum,' ‘with all his laurels.'

integrum, ‘fresh‚' ‘ with all his powers unbroken.' We have to
understand from ‘integrum victorem,’ that the subject of the
sentence, on the contrary„ has just been thrown.
