THE ODES OF HORACE

irresistible, yet with a more gracious aspect, is invoked to bless
Caesar in his endeavours to turn Roman energy upon its proper
object, foreign instead of civil war.

One of the chief conceptions of F ortune to a Roman was the “
‘ Fortuna publica,’ ‘ Fortuna populi Romani‚’ the Fortune described 2
in Plutarch’s image (Περὶ τῆς Ῥωμαίων τύχης, c. 4): ‘even as Q
Aphrodite, when she crossed the Eurotas, laid aside her mirror χ
and her ornaments and her cestus, and took spear and shield to .
adorn herself for Lycurgus’ eyeS, so when, after her sojourning with
Persians and Assyrians, with Macedonians and Carthaginians, she
(τύχη) approached the Palatine and crossed the Tiber, she laid
aside her wings and took off her sandals and left behind her ball,
the symbol of fickleness and change.'

A date for the Ode seems to be approximately given by vv.
29 foll„ which must refer to Augustus' departure from Rome in the
summer of Β. c. 27 with the purpose of invading Britain. Dion 53.
22. See Introd. to Books i—iii. ξ 3. It has been suggested that
Augustus may have inquired of the oracle about the expedition
which he was planning, and that this gave occasion to the Ode.

1. gratum, sc. ‘ tibi,' ‘ your loved Antium,’ as ⁴ dilectam Cypron,’ ²
Od. 1. 30. 2. Horace imitates the common mode of addressing
a Greek god or goddess by the title of some chief seat of their ι
worship, ‘O quae beatam diva tenes Cyprum‚’ Od. 3. 26. 9, διε.
There was at Antium a famous temple of Fortuna, or rather ⁴
apparently of the Fortunae, who were represented as two sisters,
⁴ veridicae sororeS,’ Mart. 5. 1. 3, whose images were consulted as
an oracle; cp. Suet. Calig. 57. ξ

2. praesens, not elsewhere used with an infinitive, but found '
not uncommonly in the sense of ‘powerful,' ‘prompt to any

ur ose!
p 35³4. mortale eorpus, ‘to lift frorn the dust a frail mortal man, ”
and to change to a funeral train the proud triumphal procession.'
Put man at his lowest, she can yet raise him to glory; put him at
his highest, a touch of her hand brings him down to dust again. .-
‘Funeribus ’ is the ablative, ‘vertere seria ludo,’ A. P. 226, after
the analogy of ‘ mutare.’

5. pauper. There seems to be suggested a double opposition,
the rich and the poor, the landsman and the sailor, though, after .
Horace’s way, each clause has to borrow something to complete ξ
the antithesis from the other. ‘ Pauper ruris colonus ’ implies its .
converse, the riches of the trader; ‘dominam aequoris ' is meant to .
suggest that she distributes also the treasures of the country.

7. Bithyna, rather, like *‘ Cypria trabe,’ Od. 1. 1. 13, as coming ·;
from or trading to Bithynia, a seat of commerce, Od. 3. 7. 3, Epp. ·
ὂᾶό. 33, than as built of Bithynian timber, as ‘Pontica pinus,’

. 1. 14. 11.

lacessit, ‘ tempts,’ as though the sea were a wild beast which
it was dangerous to go too near; ‘ non tangenda vada‚' od. 1. 3. 24.
