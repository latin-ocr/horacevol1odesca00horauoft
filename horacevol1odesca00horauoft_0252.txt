THE ODES OF HORACE

(‘ terrae mensorem ⁹) and arithmetic. Nothing was beyond his
power in either. His geometry was sufficient to measure the
dimensions of the whole world his arithmetic to count the sand
on the shore. In respect of the phrase‘ numero carentis harenae
men sorem, ’we notice (1) that the form of 1t involves an apparent con·
tradiction, ‘able to number what has no number’ ;(2) that to‘ count
the sand’ was a proverbial phrase for effort wasted on an impos-
sibility3 cp. Virg. Georg. 2. 103, Pind. 01. 13. 66. There 1s there-
fore some irony in the descriptionst you performed the impossible’;
(3) that Horace has probably 1n mind the actual work of a kindred
genius, Archimedes of Syracuse, who wrote a treatise‚ still extant,
called Ψωμμίτης,ι Harenarius‚’ in which he does not indeed propose
to count the existing sand, but, by way of illustrating the possibility
of expressing vast numbers, he attempts roughly to compute the
number of grains of sand which would be required to fill the sphere,
as he estimates it, which is contained between the fixed stars, · see
Dict. Biog. s. v. Archimedes.

5. temptasse, as if there were some audacity' m lifting even the
mind to the heavenly bodies; ‘animo’ of course in sense qualifies
it as well as ‘percurrisse’

6. percurrisse, from Lucr. 1. 73 ‘Omne immensum peragravit ⁷
mente animoque!

morituro, the case ruled by‘ tibi’ (Madv. § 393 c), the time fixed ᾗ
by‘ temptasse' and ‘percurrisse’ ‘What profits it you now to ¹
have scaled the homes of the sky, and in spirit to have ranged ,τ
from star to star through the round heaven, you that had still
to die'’ Cp. 2. 3. 4, where‘ moriture’ occupies the same emphatic ⁴
position. Ξ

7foll. The instances are of those who seemed at one time to ι’
have escaped the universal law: Tantalus, when he feasted with
the gods; Tithonus, when he was beloved by Aurora, and snatched «-
by her into the sky (Eur. Tro. 855 ὃν ἀστέρων τέθριππος ἔλαβε χρύσεος ,
ὄχος ἀναρπάσας) ; Minos, when Jove himself counselled him in the g
art of lawgiving (cp. Hom. Od. 19. 179 Διὸς μεγάλου ὄαριστὴς); ζ
Pythagoras, when he proved that he had outlived one death. The
form of argument is that of Hom. 11.18. 117, so often imitated, ἱ
οὐδὲ γὰρ οὐδὲ βίη Ἡρακλῆος φύγε κῆρα 1” οσπερ φίλτατος ἔσκε Διῒ ²
Κρονίωνι ἄνακτι Ι . . ,ὣς καὶ ἐγών, κτλ. Horace uses the myths of
Tantalus and Tithonus (‘ longa Tithonum minuit senectus,’ Od.
2. 16. 30) for other purposes elsewhere, here we are not to think {-
of the punishment of the one or the old age of the other, only of
ῖΙίζε fact that, though privileged above humanity, they die'd at last
li e others.

10. ‘And the son of Panthus is in Tartarus now since he ζ
descended a second time to the lower world, for all that before (for ‘f
he took down his shield and proved his knowledge of the days
of Troy) he had yielded to black death no spoils beyond mere 2
sinews and skin.’ Pythagoras was said to have supported his ’
doctrine of μετεμψύχωσις by asserting that his own soul had v
