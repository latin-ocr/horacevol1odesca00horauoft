ODES, BOOKS 1-111

Δ ξ 8. Parthiae-The defeats of Roman armies under Crassus,
Decidius Saxa (the legatus of M. Antony), and M. Antony himself,
in B.c.*53, 40, and 36, though the objects of frequent reference in
Horace's poems, and grounds of the keen interest taken in Parthian

3 affairs, and of the stress laid on the mission of Augustus to restore

Roman prestige in the East, yet all fall without the period assigned
for the compositiones the Odes. The only contemporaneous event
of Parthian history is that which is related by Dion 51. 18, and by
Justinus 42. 5. 5. Phraates IV, to whom Orodes I had resigned
his throne in B.c. 38, after some years of tyranny, provoked his
subjects to the point of rebellion. He was expelled, and Tiridates,
another member of the Arsacid house, though his exact relationship

ς- to Phraates is unknown, was put on the throne in his place. After

a short time Phraates was restored (Justinus adds, by the inter-
vention of the Scythians), and Tiridates fled to seek the protection
of Augustus, carrying with him the infant son of Phraates. These
events are undoubtedly the objects of reference in Od. 1. 26. 5, 2. 2.

ρ If we could date them therefore with certainty we should know the

² been written. And it so happens that this would incidentally throw

> light on one or two more points of Horatian chronology, for 3. 8 is

written on an anniversary (it seems almost necessarily the first
anniversary) of Horace’s escape from the falling tree. To fix,
therefore, the earliest date of this Ode would determine as much
for the other Odes which refer to the accident, i.e. 2. 13 and 3. 4.
Horace's escape again is connected (2. 17. 21—30) with Maecenas'

, reception in the theatre on his recovery from illneSS‚ and this in its

turn gives a date of some kind to 1. 20. The date, however, on

:⁴ which so much depends is not itself quite free from doubt. Justinus
{t says that Tiridates fled to Augustus, ‘ who was at that time fighting
in Spain,’ which would fix the date between Β. c. 27 and 24. Dion,
Ἴ on the contrary, narrates the event under the year 30, and makes
'⁴ Tiridates find Augustus in Syria, on his progress through Asia
>¹ after the battle of Actium. Mommsen (Res gestae divi Augusti,
Ῐ vi. 1-3) thinks the two accounts should be both accepted, as giving

two stages in the negotiations of Tiridates with Augustus, but in
that case the reference of Horace would probably be to the earlier
