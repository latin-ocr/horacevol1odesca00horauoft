EPODE XVII, 1-28

12. homicidam, a translation of ἀνδροφόνος, Hector’s epithet in
11. 1. 242 and elsewhere.

13. Hom. Il. 24. 510, of Priam before Achilles, κλαῖ’ ἁδινὰ
προπάροιθε ποδῶν Ἀχιλῆος ἐλυσθείς.

14. heu ponticarum Od. 1. 6. 6 ‘cedere nescii.’ The exclama-
tion emphasizes the epithet: ‘ We reprobate obstinacy even in him,
yet he yielded.' Orelli takes it rather as referring to the whole
sentence ‘ ad indignitatem facti‚’ to the thought of Priam ⁶ holding
the knefs and kissing the handS,’ δεινὰς ἀνδροφόνους αἴ οἱ πολέας
ΚΤανΟν νίας.

15-18. Ritter points out that the last place is reserved sor Circe,
as coming nearer home to the witch Canidia.

15. The construction is ‘ membra setosa pellibus,’ i. e. the shapes
of swine, ‘ with bristles on their hard hides.'

16. laboriosi, genitive case; Epod. 16. 60. It is a translation
of πολύτλας, πολυτλήμων.

17. sonus, the power of speech.

18. honor; Virg. Aen. 1. 591, ‘ beauty,' ‘dignity.'

20. multum, with adjective, see on Sat. 1. 3. 57 ‘multum
demissus.’

institoribus; cp. Od. 3. 6. 30.

21. verecundus color, the blush of health.

22. ossa. Bentley, followed by Haupt and Meineke, would alter
the unanimous reading of the MSS. to ‘ora‚' objecting to the
expression ‘ossa reliquit color.' But ‘ossa atque pellis ' were as
habitual a conjunction as our ‘skin and bones.’ Plaut. Aul. 3. 6.
28 ‘ossa atque pellis totus est, ita cura macet,’ and ‘ossa pelle
amicta ' is equivalent to ‘ pellem ossa amicientem.’

pelle, not used of the human skin in life and health ; see Foro,
s. ν. ‘ cutis‚' and cp. Juv. 10. 192 ‘ deformem pro cute pellem.’

23. This line has been taken to show that the Epode was written
when Horace was already ‘ praecanus’; Epp. 1. 20. 24, cp. Od. 3.
14. 25 ‘ Lenit albescens animos capillus? But it is no more real
than the other symptoms described. They are all the effects of
love in Theoc. 2. 88 foll. Καί μευ χρὼς μὲν ὁμοῖος ἐγίνετο πολλάκι
θάψῳ· Ι ἕρρευν δ’ ἐκ κεφαλᾶς πᾶσαι τρίχες· αὐτὰ δὲ λοιπὰ ξ ὀστέ’ ἔτ’ ἧς
και δέ μα.

odgribus == ‘ unguentis magicis ’ ; Epod. 5. 59 and 69.

25. Cp. Od. 2. 18. 15 ‘truditur dies die.'

neque est, οὐδ’ ἔστι, οὐδ’ ἔξεστι.

26. An amplification of the common ‘ respirare‚’ ἀναπνεῖν (sus-
taining the metaphor by which he has called his mental distress
⁴ labor ⁹), ‘to draw the breath that would ease my strained
lungs.’

27. ‘I arn constrained to believe, to my sorrow, what once
I denied.'

28. Sabe11a; Sat. 1. 9. 29. The Sabini, Marsi, and Peligni
(v. 60), are also spoken of as given to magical arts.

increpare, ‘ring through.’ It is used of a trumpet blast Virg.
