THE ODES OF HORACE

The choice of the name may be due to the remembrance of Sappho's
verse, or the reminiscence of Sappho to the name.

ODE XXIII

‘ YOU fly from me, Chloe, like a frightened kid to its dam. Ι am
ἓῖοξγηοέεῒεὶξεῑ or lion going to eat you. You are too old sor such

We have possibly part of a Greek original to this Ode in a frag·

ment of Anacreon (Fr. 52 Bergk) :—

ἀγανῶς οἶά τε νεβρὸν νεοθηλέα
γαλαθηνόν, ὅστ’ ἐν ὕλῃς κεροέσσης
ἀπολειφθεὶς ὑπὸ μητρὸς ἐπτοήθη.

Chloe’s name seems to be chosen to suit the character, see Introd.

4. aurarum et siluae, cp. Virg. Aen. 2. 728 ‘ N unc omnes terrent
aurae, sonus excitat omnis! ‘ Siluae ’ is a trisyll. as in Epod. 13. 2.

5. veris . . . adventUS, &c.‚ ‘if through the light-hung leaves
hath run the shiver of spring's approach,’ i.e. of the ‘ animae veris
comites,’ Od. 4. 12. 1 ; Lucret. 5. 735 ‘It ver et Venus et Veneris
praenuntius ante Pinnatus graditur Zephyrus? Bentley, perhaps
pressing ‘adventus' too closely, objects that when spring is still
approaching there are no leaves nor lizards nor fawns, and is dis-
pleased at the boldness of attributing the shiver to the approach of

ad ventum,’ which Bentley accepted, altering ‘vitis’ to ‘vepris,’
a conjecture which had occurred independently to Salmasius. This
is approved, though not printed, by Munro and Keller, and adopted
by Haupt, Kiessling, &c. The Schol. read it as we do.

acertos.

8. tremit, sc. ‘hinnuleus.'

9. atqui, ‘and yet,' Od. 3. 5. 49, Epod. 5. 67.

aspera, ‘angry‚' as ‘ asperas serpentis,' Od. 1. 37. 263 ‘asperum
tactu leonem,' 3. 2. 10; ‘asper siti anguis,' Virg. G. 3. 434.
