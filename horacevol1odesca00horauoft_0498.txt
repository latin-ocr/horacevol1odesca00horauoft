‘flammai fiore‚’ 1. 898. Orelli takes it of the green, sulphureus
flame of a volcano. There is a variety of reading among the
later MSS, the z in v‘irens ’being scratched by a later hand in
three, ‘’urens being found in several, ‘qurens which Bentley
preferred, in a few.

Canidia is a laboratory of magic drugs, in which the fires will not ’

slacken till Horace is burnt to ashes, which the wind can carry
about and make sport of.

36. 5119811ᾶὶωῷ composition, ‘payment in lieu of punishment?
‘When will the end come, or how can 1 buy myself off Ρ Cp.
Catull. 64. 173, of the human tribute exacted by the Minotaur,
‘dira ferens stipendia tauro.² It is not uncommonly used of
a tribute imposed on a conquered country; ‘stipendio multare,’
Cic. pro Balb. 18. 41.

39. mendaci lyra, parallel to v, 20. He must lie to praise her,
but he will lie if she pleases. Orelli thinks that it is an equivoque,
and that she might‘have taken ‘mendaci’ to mean ‘which lied
xbefore in reviling you ' 3 but the other meaning of the words would
have been the more obvious of the two. The humour consists,
not in any by-play which Canidia is supposed to miss, but in the
offering as a palinode a lampoon more bitter than that which .it
professes to retract.

42. infamis = ‘ infamatae,’ sc. ‘ a Stesichor0.’ For the story see
Introd. to Od. 1. 16.

vice, ‘on behalf of.’ Orelli and Dillr. follow Bentley in pre-
ferring ‘vicem‚' the reading which is found in two MSS. of no
great age; the construction, then, as in Plaut. Rud. 3. 5. 34 ‘Vos
respondetote istinc istarum vicem?

46. obsoleta ; cp. (with Orelli) ‘Virtus . . . neque alienis sordibus
obsolescit,’ Cic. pro Sest. 28. 60; ‘of tattered reputation from the
meanness of your parentage.’ Horace uses it elsewhere *of a
tumbledownhouse3 Od.2. 10. 6.

47. prudens, ‘well skilled? It 15 perhaps with special reference
to the emphatic‘ pauperumss as the Scholiast suggests; she shows
her wisdom m choosing graves that were not guarded.

48. novendialia, ‘ninth- -day ashes' seem to mean ‘fresh buried?
These were held fitter for a wizard's purpose; cp. Ov. Her. 6. 90

‘certaque de tepidis colligit ossa rogis,' &c. The adjective
‘novendialis' properly means ‘continuing for nine days' ; and this
