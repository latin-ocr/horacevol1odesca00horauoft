CARMEN SAECULARE

‘ PHOEBUS and Diana, grant the prayers duly offered at this
sacred season (v. 1—8).

O sun, ever changing yet ever the same, let Rome’s pre-eminence
be as changeless (v. 9—12).

Diana, birth goddess, guard our mothers (v. 13-16).

Bless our new marriage laws to the increase of our people,
that each “saeculum '' may find us still celebrating this festival
v.17—24Q
( O Desfinies, fulfil the happy oracles, and add future to past
boons; Earth give us all her blessings (v. 25—32).

Apollo, hear us boys (v. ⁷33, 34).

Diana, hear us girls (v. 3 5, 36).

If Rome is your creation, the remnant saved from Troy for
Aeneas' piety, give our youth Aeneas’ manners, and our old men
his happy old age. Give Rome all blessings (v. 37—48).

And grant [this prayer seems rather to be addressed to Jupiter
and Juno] the prayers now offered by Aeneas' great son (v. 49—52).

He has subdued the Mede, the Scyth, the Indian. He has
restored peace and virtue and plenty (v. 52—60).

Phoebus, pleased with his Palatine temple, promises another
lustrum and increasing'years of prosperity (v. 61-68).

Diana listens to the Fifteen and to the chorus of boys and gir1s3
and Jupiter and all the gods approve and join in their blessing’

(v.69-76ffl

The Ode is addressed in the first place—as we see in its first and
last words, and in Od. 4. 6, which belongs to it—to Apollo and
Diana. It was to be sung in the first place ‘in Palati0,' after the
sacrifice to them, which was meant to be the crown and most
characteristic feature of the festival. But it also is evidently in-
tended to gather up and enforce the ideas of the whole celebration.
We are reminded of the prayers offered on the three nights to the
Ilithyiae, the Moerae or Parcae, and Demeter. It would be strange
if it omitted the great deities worshipped especially on the Capi-
toline, to whom the ceremonies of the first and second day were
dedicated, especially as we know from the inscription that in some
way or other the hymn was sung also in the Capitol. Mommsen
pointed out that vv. 49-52 must belong to thern, inasmuch as the
inscription speaks of oxen as being the sacrifice offered to them
(cp. Sibyll. 12-16, which adds that the oxen were white), whereas
the offering on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana consisted of cakes.
He goes further, and interprets the whole passage from v. 37 to v. 52
