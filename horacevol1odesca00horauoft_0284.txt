THE ODES OF HORACE

(de Clem. 1. 10) ranks him with Sallustius as among the first to
reconcile themselves to Augustus.

It is worth noting‚ as an illustration of Horace’s way of placing
his poems, that this Epicurean Ode follows the Stoicism of the
preceding one, just as Epp. 1. 16, in which he preaches Stoic
moralsty, stands between 1. 15, in which he likens himself to the
Epicurean Maenius, and 1. 17, in which he gives cynical advice to
Scaeva. Cp. the sequence of the tenth and eleventh Odes of this
book.

1. aequam . . . arduis. There is probably some slight feeling

of the verbal antithesiS, ‘ when life’s path is steep (ἀνάντης) let your ⁷

mind at least be on a level.'

3. insolenti, a word of the schools: ‘extravagant joy’ was for·
bidden to a philosopher, Cic. Tusc. 5. 14. 42‘ quem temperantia.
insolenti alacritate gestire non sinat!

5. seu. ‚seu depend on ‘moriture,’ ‘for that thou must soon
die, whether thy life has been sad or merry.’ With the emphatic
position of ‘ moriture ’ cp. Od. 1. 28. 6.

6. remoto, ‘retired,' ‘quiet’3 cp. Epod. 2. 23-28.

per dies festos,‘ per ’might denote either‘ through the entire ³

day' as ‘per brumamss Epp. 1. 11. 19, or ‘on each holiday, 'as ‘per
exactos annos, ’.Od 3. 22. 6. It is opposed to the life of yunbroken
sadness (‘ omni ternpore ‘), and means ‘miss no opportunity of
ωἶήὶῗῗὲἔίοω nota, the brand of the innermost, and so the
earliest· filled bin. The ‘amphora’ itself was branded or a label

was attached to it with the name of the wine and of the consul μ

in whose year it was bottled3 ‘patriam titulumque? Juv. S. 5. 33.
Cp.‘ nota Falerni, Sat. 1. 10. 24.

9-1 1. quo. ..quidf to what purpose? why. >’ ‘to what purpose
but that you may make merry in the shade ?' For ‘ quo’ the Edd.
compare Virg. E. 6. 23 ‘ Quo vincula nectitis? ’ For the change
of conjunction Ov. Met. 13. 516 ‘ Quo ferrea resto? quidve moror ?'
This is the reading of the best MSS., and of Porph. ; but there are
some signs of disturbance in the MSS., and there is not Horace’s
full point in the rhetorical questions. Relative local adverbs to
match‘ huc’ in v. 13, are more what we should look for. A good
many MSS. offer‘ quo, ’‘— quo, ’which might be taken' 111 11131 way,

‘hither, to the spot whither the boughs stretch out and the stream
hurries down! The Schol. in the second clause read some word
which they took 10 mean ‘'why? for they annotate ‘subaudiendum‚
si ea non utimur’ ;but they may have been interpreting‘ quo, ’and

it may be the fact that‘ quo ’admitted of this interpretation which

led to its corruption to ‘quid.' But‘ quo’ is metrically indefensible,
in spite of Epod. 5. 100, and‘ quo et,' the only possible alternative
offered by Μ55., 1135 the air of an emendation.
