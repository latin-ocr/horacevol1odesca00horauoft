trochus. Nunc ubi perfusa est oleo labente iuventus Defessos
artus Virgine tingit aqua! It would seem from this that they used
the oil after exercise and before bathing. It has been otherwise
taken of the anointing before some exercises, such as wrestling
(Od. 1. 8. 8), and as implying such exercises ; ‘ with the wrestler's
oil still on them.’ ,

8. eques, in app. to ‘Hebri nit0r‚' taken as i. q. ‘Hebrus

ODE XIII

‘BANDUSIA Sabinensis agri regio est in qua Horatii ager fuit:

seems to be at home at the spring. The surrounding objects are
too familiar to obtrude themselves on the picture. The spring,
now called ‘ Fontana degli Oratini‚’ on the hill-side between the
two suggested sites for Horace's farm, answers well enough to
