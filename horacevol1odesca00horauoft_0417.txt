aster all, with some reason) with all the interpretations offered, cuts
the knot by reading ‘Isque dum procedit,’ of Caesar.

57. ‘ Whose horns are like the moon three days old.' The homely
ending of the Ode has been severely criticized. It is at least in·-
tentional on Horace's part3 see Introd. to Odes i—iii, ξ 11. 3, and
on 3. 5. 55. On the immediate topic of the last six lines see on 3.
13. 4. In this place the detailed account of the intended offering
increases the contrast of vv. 53, 54, and balances to some extent
the inequality. ‘You will sacrifice animals brought by the score
from your “latifundia‚'’ Ι the calf which Ι bred myself, whose
birthday and marks I know by heart.’ It is like his offer to Mae-
cenas in 1. 20. 1-4 q. v. ‘ common wine; but home-made, carefully
stored, and with pleasant memories about- it.’

as other men’s. For them are the training and the prizes of
Grecian games—the life of a soldier and the triumph on the
Capitol; for him the woods and waters of Tibur and the glory

acknowledges me as such, and the voice of envy is still. It is thy
gift, Ο Muse; both the inspiration and the popular acknowledge-
ment of it.'

Compare with the Ode 1. 1, when he looks to Maecenas’ taste to
give him the rank which here he assumes as given him by the
voice of Rome. There are many parallelisms of thought and
expression between the two Odes; there is the same division of
the objects of Greek and Roman ambition (‘ sunt quos curriculo
