THE ODES OF HORACE

‘iustis divis,' sc. ‘qui Caesari victoriam et reditum merenti dederunt.⁹
Many of the older MSS. have ‘sacris.’ Bentley shows that both
construetions of ‘operari' are equally legitimate. ‘Iustis sacris'
would mean ‘rites duly performed!

8. supplice vitta3 Virg. Aen. 4. 637 ‘ipsa pia tege tempora
vitta.' This seems distinct from its ordinary use, by sreeborn maids
and matrons, to confine the hair.

10. puellae, of young wives, cp. 3. 22. 2. The matrons are
bidden assist Livia and Octavia in the religious rites. The return-
· ing soldiers and the young wives to whom they are returning are
bidden εὐφημεῖν, to keep a sacred silence, or not to interrupt the
ceremony by too noisy delight.

11. male ominatis, δυσφήμοις. Τ1115 was the reading of V,
and the text which Aer. and Porph. interpreted (6 116 incaute
loquentes verbis omina facerent '). B and other good MSS. have
‘nominatis' It seems to be true, as Bentley argues, that no other
instance can be quoted of a hiatus between a short and a long
vowel when there is no natural break in the line; and such com-
pounds as ‘suaveolens,’ ‘graveolens,’ &c., usually lose the ‘eh’ in
scansion. On the other hand, while the temptation would be strong
to remedy an obvious blot, and the insertion of ‘n’ would easily
suggest itself, we lack any authority for the use of ‘ nominatis’ in
any appropriate sense. Of professed conjectures, Bentley's ‘ inomi-
natis ' is the most plausible. In that case ‘ male ’ must mean ‘ with
evil effect,' like ‘fraude mala,' Od. 1. 3. 28.

14. eximet, ‘banish.’

15. mori metuam, not in the sense of 3. 9. 11, but in the less
usual sense of ‘ne moriar metuam.' With the sentiment cp. 4. 15.
17 foll. ‘ Custode rerum Caesare non furor civilis,' &c.

18—20. ‘A cask of wine of the date of the Marsic or Social War
(Β. C. 90—88), if one has possibly (qua is an abl„ as Virg. Aen. 1. 18
‘si qua fata sinant ') escaped the roving bands of Spartacus (in the
Servile War fifteen years later).’ So the wine would be sixty-three
years old3 see on 3. 8. 12. Juvenal’s ‘Calcatamque tenet bellis
Socialibus uvam‚’ 5. 31, is most likely a reference to this passage
rather than a real date of wine which was drinkable in his time.
Ritter points out that the reference to the succession of civil wars
has probably a secondary purpose as heightening the feeling of the
last stanza‚ the peace and security conferred on the world by
Caesar's rule.

19. Spartacum, Epod. 16. 5.

21. argutae, ‘ clear-voiced,' for she is a singer.

22. murreum, fragrant with myrrh. Virg. Aen. 12. 100 ‘crinis
. . . murrha madentis.'

cohibere crinem, i.e. to adorn herself for the purpose of coming
to my house3 cp. 2. 11. 12.

25. albescens; as he calls himself four years afterwards, ‘ prae-
canum‚' Epp. 1. 20. 24. Horace was now in his forty-first year.

27. ferrem, for the tense see Madv. ξ 347, 0135. 2.
