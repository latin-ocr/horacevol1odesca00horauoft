BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE VIII, 5—ODE IX

15, 16. ‘ It shall be a sober and peaceful merrymaking'; no
‘impius clamor‚’ 1. 27. 7 3 no ‘male ominata verba‚' 3. 14. 11.
The purpose is apparently to make more alluring to Maecenas the
contrast from the tumults and troubles of the city. Perhaps also
to give something of a religious air to the banquet of thanksgiving.

17. civilis, ‘ domesticas‚’ opposed to the foreign questions of the
following lines-

super urbe; Virg. Aen. 4. 233 ‘Nec super ipse sua molitur
laude laborem.’ For the reference see Introd. to Books i-iii, ξ 8

18. Daoi Cotison183 see Introd. to Books i—iii, ξ 7.

19. Medus, ‘the Parthian’3 see on 1. 2. 22. The point that
the Mede's whole offensive power is exhausted on himself in
intestine quarrels is brought out by the position of ‘sibi ' standing
where it seems equally open to be governed by ‘ infestus,’ ‘ luctuosis‚’
and ‘dissidet.' See· on 1. 3. 6.

21. vetus hostien Od. 2. 6. 2, 4. 14. 41, Epp. 1. 12. 26.

23. laxo arou3 Virg. Aen. 11. 874, of retreat, ‘laxos referunt
umeris languentibus arcus? The Scythians are thinking of retiring
from the plains which -they have been accustomed to harry. Cp.
2. 9. 23.

25. neglegens, ‘ Be careless for a time; be a private citizen:
spare thy over-anxiety lest in any way the people should take
barm? ‘ Ne laboret ’ seems to be constructed‚ in Horace’s manner,
ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘ neglegens ' (= ‘ non curans ⁹) and ‘ cavere! Orelli,
Ritter, and Dillr. take ‘privatus’ as = ‘cum sis privatus‚’ ‘since
{ssxrzzss’e’fsf ³Mba¹2t03322¹2yo1¹3¹=133 ⁶303&ss ifffossssssffsshufflfiffifflssss
the law they might be. He would not after saying ‘you have on
your shoulders the whole weight of home and foreign policy‚' add,
‘after all you are only an “ eques‚'' it is nothing to you if public
affairs go wrong! Bentley is not more satisfactory ; he thinks that
‘ privatus cavere,’ ‘ to be anxious for your private interests‚' answers
to the ‘ public care ’ of the preceding verse.

26, 27. All the good MSS. have ‘ et ’ at the end of v. 26, all but
Aa (which have ac) omit the copula at the end of 27. Bentley
would omit it in v. 26, and insert ‘ et ⁹ in 27, ancl has been followed

’ by many editors.

ODE IX

THE reconciliation of two lovers who have quarrelled: one is
‘Lydia,' the other is not named. The form of the Ode is like the
amoebean eclogues of Theocritus and Virgil.

We may note the dramatic propriety of the feelings throughout.
h‘His the pride of possession, hers the pride of being first in

1s eyes».
