ODE XIX

‘I THOUGHT my days of passion were over, but love and wine
and idleness and Glycera’s beauty are too much for me. Again
1 feel the full power of Venus—again must leave all other subjects

4⁷ to write love songs—-again think only of propitiating Venus and
J moderating the pains of my passion.’

 

See Introd. to Ode 4. 1, which Horace links to this Ode by
repeating the first line.

for several purposes in a sacrifice.
