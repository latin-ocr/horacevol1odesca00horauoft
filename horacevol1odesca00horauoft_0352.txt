THE ODES OF HORACE

drawing a stream passes easily into that of tracz'ng lt. Cp. 3. 17. 5
‘nepotum Per memores genus omne fastos Auctore ab illo ducis
originem.’ And Virg. G. 3. 121 ‘ Et patriam Epirum referat fortis-

conjecture, ‘trahenti,’ seems to hpavt’e belgi the reading of the Schol.
Cruq., and is in itself more likely, ‘a precedent which would bring
ruin.’ Bentley would read ‘ exempli trahentis,’ construed after the
analogy of ‘ mali exempli,’ ἃς.

17. periret. The lengthening of the short syllable is possibly
justified by the caesura, see on 2. 20. ¹3· It is not parallel to
‘ caeca timet aliunde‚’ 2. 13. 16, and other cases in which the metrical
accent falls on the lengthened syllable. Horace does not seem to
have allowed a second trochee in the Alcaic‚ as Alcaeus himself
did. No alteration is likely; ‘perirent’ is doubtful in point of
number, and ‘perires' (Lachmann) is too rhetorical.

immiserabilis, unpstied, as he deserves to be.

18. signa has force as the first word of Regulus’ speech, striking ἶ
again the key-note of the Ode, recalling the bitterest memory of .
Carrhae, the loss of the standards. The twice repeated ‘ego' is ⁷

also emphatic, ‘ Listen to me—1 can tell you what the captivity of
Roman soldiers really means. I have seen it.’

20. eine caede derepta. Contrast Virgil’s (Aen. 1 1. 193) ‘Spolia
occisis derepta Latinis.’

22. retorta, so in the description of a triumph, Epp. 2. 1. 191
‘ Mox trahitur manibus regum fortuna retortis!

tergo libero, ablative of place; more usually ‘post tergum.’
‘ A freeman’s back ’ ; see on 1. 15. 19 ‘adulteros crines.'

23. portas, the gates of Carthage.

non clausas, the sign of peace and, security; ‘apertis otia

· *asumma-au... «ω.- .-

portis,' A. Ρ. 199. Cp. Virg. Aen. 2. 27 ‘ Panduntur portae, iuvat ζ

ire‚’ &c.

24. Marte nostro, with ‘ populata,’ ‘the fields that our arms had ·

ravaged again in tillage.'

27. damnum, ‘pecuniae‚' Porph. Ritter well quotes ‘grandes
rhombi patinaeque Grande ferunt una cum damno dedecus,' Sat. 2.
2. 95. ‘The money is wasted, for the ransomed soldier will be
worthless.

neque . . . nec = ‘ as not . . . so not.’ Compare the use of οὔτε
. . . οὔτε in a simile, Aesch. Cho. 2 58—261 οὔτ’ αἰετοῦ γένεθλ’ ἀποφθείρας,
πάλιν Ι πέμπειν ἔχοις ἂν σήματ’ εὐπιθῆ βροτοῖς· Ι οὔτ’ ἀρχικός σοι πᾶς
ὅδ’ αὐανθεὶς πυθμὴν Ι βωμοῖς ἀρήξει βουθύτοις ἐν ἤμασι.

28. medicata. A translation (as ‘venenum’ in Epp. 2. 1. 207

‘ Lana Tarentino violas imitata veneno,’ cp. Virg. G. 2. 465) of the 2-

Greek φάρμακον-φαρμάσσειν, used of dyeing.
fuco, any kind of dye. Properly a seaweed, used apparently for
giving the first dye to stuffs which were to be dyed purple, Plin.
