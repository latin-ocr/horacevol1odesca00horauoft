THE ODES OF HORACE

20. vitream, as a sea—nymph (cp. ‘vitreo pont0,' Od. 4. 2. 3),
daughter of the Oceanid Perse, Hom. Od. 10. 1393 so Thetis is
called ‘[Achillis] mater caerula‚' Epod. 13. 16. Statius has imitated
it, Silv. 1. 3. 85 ‘vitreae iuga perfida Circes,’ and 1. 5. 15 ‘Ite deae
virides, liquidosque advertite vultus, Et vitreum Veneris crinem
redimite corymbis.²

21. innocentis, that will not lead to brawls.

22. duces, ‘drink,' as Od. 3. 3. 34 and 4. 12. 14.

Semeleius Thyoneus. Semele and Thyone were both names of
Bacchus’ mother. So he plays on Bacchus’ own name, Lyaeus,
Od. 3. 21. 16, Epod. 9. 38: ‘ the son of Semele who is also Thyone‚’
the latter name being connected with θύειν, to rage furiously.
Cp. Θυιάς, a raving Bacchante.

23. confundet, an extension of the usual phrase, ‘miscere proe-
lia’3 the drunken brawl is represented as a ‘blind and aimless
quarrel’ between Mars and Bacchus.

24 foll. You will be out of the way of the petulance with which
Cyrus vents his jealous suspicions.

25. male disparis a poor little match for him’; ‘male’ in-
creasing the unsavourable force of the adj. as in S’at. 1. 3. 45,
1. 4. 66.

26. incontmentis, ‘ violent,’ ‘tipsy,' the epithet belonging more
properly to the person than to his hands. See on Od. 1. 15. 20.

ODE XVIII

‘THE purpose of the Ode may be summed up, 'says Dillenburger,
‘in the lines of Theognis (509, ed. Bergk):—

οἶι ος πινόμενος πουλὺς κακόν· ἢν δέ τις αὐτὸν
πίνῃ ἐπισταμένως, οὗ κακόν, ἀλλ’ ἀγαθόν.

‘Plant the vine, Varus, especially where it grows so well as at
Tibur, and drink of its fruit ; but it is possible to drink too much.’

Varus is called by the Scholiasts ‘Quintilius Varus,' and generally
identified with the Quintilius the friend of Virgil, who died in
Β. C. 24, and whose death is lamented in Od. 1. 24.

The form at least of the poem was suggested by an Ode of
Alcaeus, of which we have the first line, Athen. 10. 8 :—

μηδὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρότερον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω.
Metre——Second A sclepiad

1. saera, ‘god- given, ’belonging to Bacchus. Horace begins by ἦ

granting to the full the virtues of wine.

severis, for the mood, see on Od.1.11.1; ‘sero'is Virgil’s
word for planting trees, G. 2. 275, ἃς.

2. mite, a soft and kindly soil, opp. to VirgiP‘s difficile,’ G. 2.
279, ‘amarum, ’ib. 238.
