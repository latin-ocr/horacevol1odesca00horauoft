THE ODES OF HORACE

2. ‘ Since the world has it that it was from him that the Lamiae
of old days took their name, as well as the whole race of their
children's children whose memory lives in Fasti, he doubtless is
the founder to whom thou tracest thine origin.' In other words,
‘Since all the Lamiae, ancient and modern, are descended from
him, doubtless you are.' The omission of ‘tu’ before ‘ducis,’
although the person is emphatic, is paralleled in Od. 2. 17. 30.
Cp. 1. 1. 35, 4. 2. 33. ‘Ducit‚’ constr. as the verb after ‘genus

omne,' is an emendation of D. Heinsius (1580-1655) strongly ⁷

advocated by Bentley. It has no MS. authority, but has been
received by several editors (Keller and Munro amongst them), and
would make the parenthesis run more smoothly.

hine‚'‘from him.' Sat. 14. 6. Cp. Virg. Aen. 1. 21 ‘Hinc
populum . . . venturum.’ Cp. the use of ‘unde‚’ Od. 1. 12. 17.

4. memores fastos3 4. 14. 4.

5. auctore, of the founder of a family3 1. 2. 36, Virg. Aen.

7. innantem Maricae litoribus, refers to the marshes near
Minturnae, at the mouth of the Liris (Garigliano), known in history
as the place where Marius was for a time concealed. Marica
was a nymph worshipped at Minturnae, identified by some with
Circe.

9. 1⁸5oe tyrannus, εὐρυκρείων. Virg. Aen. 1. 21 ‘populum late
re em.

g10. inutili, not an epithet quite without bearing on the context.
It helps to make us feel the dreariness and odiousness of the storm
out of doors, which is to contrast with the cheer which there may
be within. Its work is purely destructive3 it brings down the
leavfes which are of use, and strews the shore with seaweed which
is o no use.

12. aquae augur-3 3. 27. 10 ‘imbrium divina avis imminentum.’

13. annosa; 4. 13. 24.

15. curabis. The future seems to have the force of ‘ of course
you will? ‘Curabis Genium’ is an extension of the common‘
‘ curare se ipsum,’ ‘ curare corpus! When the Genius was viewed
more distinctly as something externa] to and separate from the
person whose spiritual double it was, it was said rather ‘ placari,’
‘piari floribus et vino.’ Cp. A. P. 210, Epp. 2. 1. 144.

16. operum. For genitive cp. 2. 9. 17, 3. 27. 69, Madv. ξ 261,
obs. 4.

ODE XVIII

A HYMN to Faunus: cp. 1. 17. 1-8. Horace prays that the Ἢ

visits of the god to his lands may be kindly, and promises that

the due kid and wine and incense shall be offered at the Faunalia ·

on the nones of December, the holiday of cattle and of villagers,
the day of peace, when even the wolf strays harmlessly among the
