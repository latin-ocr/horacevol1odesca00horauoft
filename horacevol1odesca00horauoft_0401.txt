BOOK 111, ODE XXVII, 11—50

meo? The other possible construction, ‘filiae (gen. case) nomen

Δ relictum (sc. a me),’ seems, as Bentley argues, to require ‘ O pater!

 

Ο relictum, ' &c., as they then become separate exclamations.

Europa’s father was, according to Homer, Il. 14. 321, Phoenix3
according to Ovid, Met. 1. c., Agenor.

35. pietas vieta fur-orm cp. Ov. Met. 1. 149 Victa iacet pietas!
This· 1s better than with Aer„ to take‘ victa furore' with‘ dixit, as
a description of Europa.

37. unde quo. The two questions run together after the Greek
fashion. τίς πόθεν γεγώς; Eur. Alc. 213. ‘Asyndeton convenit com-
moto loquentis animo, ’Ritter. Mitsch. compares Virgil'sexpression
of Turnus' bewilderment, Aen. 10. 669⁴ Quo feror? unde abii ? quae
me fuga quemve reducet. ²⁹ This is perhaps consistent with the
feeling that if she answered her questions, the answer would be,

‘from a happy home to shame and danger’3 but in the first instance

the picture seems to be of bewilderment, expressed by a rapid
succession of contradictory thoughts, though they settle down at
last into self· ·reproach.

levis, ‘is light for,’ i. e. a light punishment for.

una mors, ‘ a single death ' = death by itself, without additional
pains. Soph. Ant. 308 οὐχ ὑμὶν ’Ἅιδης μοῦνος ἀρκέσει. Propertius
imitates it, 4. 4. 17 ‘ Et satis una malae potuit mors esse puellae ’ 3

38. virginum eulpae. Orelli points out (against Markland,
who wished to read ‘virginis ⁹) that the plural sostens, by general-
izing, the truth. She seels the special application, but is likely to
shrink from expressing it. Similarly, Bentley injures the delicacy
of the passage by changing‘ vitiis’ to‘ vitio! The reasons which he
gives for the change—the generality of the plural and the technical
use of the singular as almost= ‘stuprum ’—really indicate Horace’s
purpose in preferring‘ vitiis?

42. somnium ducit, ‘the fancy brings a dream,’ i. e. comes in
a dream.

47. enitar, ‘I would use all my strength’ ; it contrasts with
‘multum amati!

48. monstri. Some good MSS. have‘ tauri? but, as Orelli
observes, this reading was probably a gloss, helped to usurp the
text by v. 72. Europa has called it, in v. 45, ‘infamem iuvencum,’
but she has learnt long ago that it was not merely what it seemed'.
It should be noticed that Horace imagines the bull to have vanished
the moment he has landed Europa on the Cretan shore. She is
then alone, conscipus that she has been brought there for a bad

the clue to her conduct, ‘ shameless ’ from beginning to end.
