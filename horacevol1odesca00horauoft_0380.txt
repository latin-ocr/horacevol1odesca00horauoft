THE ODES OF HORACE

banquet already prepared (cp. 2. 7. 21 foll„ 2. 11. 18 foll„ but it is
more abrupt than these Odes) : ‘ We have to drink the new month,
and our friend Murena, the newly-elected Augur. Strike up with
pipe and harp3 no grudging, scatter the roses. Let morose old
Lycus hear our riot‚ and his ill-matched young wife next door.
We are better matched here, Telephus and Rhode, I and Glycera.’

The Ode explains itself less clearly than most. The point lies
clearly in the toast to the ‘Augur Murena‚’ but there must be links
that are lost to uS. It may be questioned who is the supposed
interlocutor in the first eight lines. It has been usually taken
to be the Telephus of v. 26 : but this is by no means clear. Ritter
imagined the name to be chosen by a fancied etymology (τῆλε
φάο-ς) to suggest Heliodorus the ‘ rhetor‚' ‘ Graecorum longe doctis-
simus’ of Sat. 1. 5. 3, with whose profession such antiquarian
questions would suit. But, on the other hand, it may be pointed
out that Telephus is the name which Horace seems to appropriate
here as in 1. 13 and 4. 11 to an ideal character, a lover who has
youth and beauty.

For Murena see on 2. 2. 5 and 2. 10 Introd.

The ‘new moon' means apparently the first of the month, on
which a feast was usual, as in Greek νουμηνία was transferred by

usage so completely from the first of the natural lunar month q

to the first of the calendar month, that the real new moon was
expressed by νουμηνία κατὰ τὴν σελήνην, Thue. 2. 28. For the
