BOOK Π, ODE rx, 16—ODE X, 6

The person to whom -the Ode is addressed is called in some good
MSS. ‘ Licinius Murena,’ and he has been generally identified gwith
the‘ augur Murena’ of Od.3.19. 11 (see also Sat. 1. 5. 38). He
again is taken to be the person variously called ‘ Lucius Murena'
(Vell. Pat. 2. 91), ‘Licinius Murena’ (Dion 54. 3), ‘ Varro Murena’
(Suet. Tib. 8), and said by Dion (1. c.) to have been the brother of
Proculeius and of Terentia, the wife of Maecenas.

This Murena was accused in B.c. 22 εἴτ’ οὖν ἀληθῶς εἴτε καὶ ἐκ
διαβολῆς (Dion 1. c.), of a conspiracy with Fannius Caepio, and, in

The history and relationships of Murena have been investigated
with much care and acuteness by Dr. Verrall in his ‘Studies in
Horace.' He proves that he was a distinct person from A. Terentius
Varro Murena usually identified with him, who stands in the Capi-
toline Fasti as one of the original Consuls in Β. C. 23 (this would
mean apparently that he died early in that year), and who is also
probably the Murena who had been employed by Augustus in the
subjugation of the Salassi in 13. C. 25. He brings out very clearly
the effects upon Roman society and upon the relations between
Augustus and Maecenas of the conspiracy of Β. C. 22, though
we cannot all follow him in respect of the many cryptic allusions
to it which he detects in Horace’s Odes.

6-8. In po'int of grammar, doubtless‚ tutus belongs to the first
- clause, sobrius to the second3 ‘he avoids the meanness of a
ruinous hovel and is safe, is sober and avoids the palace that raises
envy’; but in sense, ‘ sober and therefore safe ’ is the idea of the
sentence, and neither adjective is confined to its own clause. The
safety of moderation is dwelt on further in the next stanza, its
prudence in the one following, which suggests the mutability of
ortune.
