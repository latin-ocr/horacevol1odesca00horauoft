BOOK IV, ODE XIV, 2—25

compare 1. 33. 1 ‘.doleas ..cur ,praeniteat’3 for the method we
may compare v. 7 of this Ode, inasmuch as the passive ‘spectandus
quantis? &c., implies a possible active, ‘spectare aliquem quantis,
διε. For the violation of the usual caesura see Index of Metres.

18. devota morti liberae == ‘libere‚’ they gave themselves freely
to death, stood to be killed; or == ‘ the death of freemen,' death in
preference to bondage.

19. ruinis, ‘ shocks,’ as of an earthquake.

20. indomitas, ‘tameless.’ The simile is double: the freedom
and obstinacy of the waters‚ the fierce rushes and persistance of the
south wind. We need not press the epithet to a contradiction, as
Bentley’s too logical criticism does, as though it would require that
Tiberius should not have conquered the Raeti. The simile depends
grammatically on what follows, the construction being ‘qualis
Auster exercet undas [ita.. .ta1’i modo] impiger hostiurn vexare
turmas‚’ ‘impiger, '&c., grammatically again, qualifying‘ fatigaret!

prope qualis. This abatement of the similitude has been com-
plained of (perhaps hypercritically) as more suitable to prose, and
so to pogms ‘sermoni propiora' as Sat. 2. 3. 268⁴ tempestatis prope
ritu mo ilia’

22. scindente nubes, ‘when they shine through torn clouds.’
The expression combines, in a vague way, the ideas of the date,
‘when Pleiads are specially noticeable' (the time meant may be
near either equinox3 see Dict. Ant. Pleiades, s.v. Astronomia)‚
and of stormy weaHzer, ‘when the sky is full of broken clouds.’
Orelli takes ‘ scindente ' of their opening the clouds, i. e. letting the
rain fall.

23. vexare ; 3. 2. 3. For inf. see App. 2, ξ 2.

24. per ignis. Bentley, as usual, is far better than his critics.
His way out of the difficulty, by substituting conjecturally ‘ensis,'
is not one in which we can follow him. But he disposes, in ad-
vance, of all the parallels which are still quoted on the view that
the expression is metaphorical = ‘per medium ardorem pugnaess
Com. Cruq. One class, such as Virgil's‘ medias acies mediosque
per ignis, ’.Aen 7. 296, indicate the direct opposite, for they refer
to the literal fires of Troy3 and Silius’ imitations (14.175 and 15.
41) are just the same—the fires are as literal as the sw ords. The
other class, such as Horace' s own ‘per mare . . . per saxa, per
ignis,' Epp. 1. 1. 463 ‘ignis Per medios fluviosque ruentis,' Sat. 2.
3. 56, establish the proverbial use of ‘fire,' as one among many
metaphors of extreme dangers or obstacles ; but do not parallel the
substitution of ‘to ride his horse through the middle of the fire,' for
‘ through the hottest fight.' We have gone too far in the sentence
with unmetaphorical language, to tolerate being pulled up suddenly
by a bold metaphor. The fires may well be the burning villages of
the Raeti through which Tiberius forced his way.

25. sio volvitur. The simile is Homeric: Il. 5. 87. Horace
particularizes the river of his own birthplace; see on 1. 22. 13.

tauriformis, according to the common representation of rivers
