Menelaus sleW‚ I-lom. Il. 17. 69), a fact which he proved by re-

, cognizing Euphorbus’ shield hung with others in a temple at Argos.

Tartara, not of the place of punishment, but of the lower world
⁵³ generally, as in Virg. G. 1. 36, where the Elysian plains seem to be

,π included in it. No distinction is intended between ‘ Tartara ’ and
’ ⁴ Orc0.' ⁶ Orco demittere’ is a Virgilian phrase representing Homer's
J. Ἀ’ἱδι προῖάπτειν. For the dat. see on Od. Ι. 24. 18.

14. iudice te. As addressed to Archytas this is simple, and the

case of Pythagoras is a natural climax.

auctor, ‘master,' ‘teacher,’ Cic. ad Att. 7. 3 ‘auctor Latinitatis’ 3
Virg. Aen. 11. 339 ‘ consiliis habitus non futilis auctor. '

15. sed, advers. to the last clause. He may have been a great
philosopher, but he was a man, and death knows no exceptions.

16. via leti, the same image, Od. 2. 17. 11 ‘supremum carpere
iter.'

17. spectacula. The metaphor is from gladiatoria] shows;
wars are the ‘ludi’ in which Mars delights, Od. 1. 2. 37. The
Furies are represented as stirring up war in Virg. Aen. 7. 324 foll„
- 12. 8 foll.

s 18.45avidum‚ early editions read ‘avidis’3 but even if we want
¹ a hit at the trader's eagerness for gain, ‘avidis’ is neither so

'‘ delicate nor so forcible as ‘avidum,' which means ‘greedy as they'3
’ζ’ cp. Od. 2. 18. 30 ‘ rapacis Orci,’ where the epithet is clearly meant

'⁷ to compare the greediness of death for his prey with the greediness

ἕ of the rich landlord who is laying field to field.

„ 20. saeva, Od. 1. 19. 1, perhaps with a reminiscence of the
Homeric epithet, [ἐπ]αινὴ Περσεφόνεια.

eaput fugit. None could die (acc. to Virg. Aen. 4. 698) till
ζῑ Proserpine had cut a lock of hair from his head3 the idea being
³· that the dying man was a victim offered to the powers below
‚ (‘ victima Orci, ’ Od. 2. 3. 24), as it was usual to begin a sacrifice by
ἦ cutting some hairs from the forehead of the victim and burning
ζ them, Virg. Aen. 6. 245. Cp Eur. Alc. 74, where Θάνατος says,

l, στείχω δ’ ἐπ’ αυτὴν, ὣς κατ-ἄρξωμαι ξίφει· Ι“ ιερὸς γὰρ οὗτος τῶν κατ-α
'',· χθονὸς θεῶν Ι” οτου τόδ’ ἔγχος κρατὸς ἁγνίσῃ τρίχα.

fugit. The perf. tense, as Od. 2 13. 20 ‘leti vis rapuit rapietque
gergi-&me quoque. ‘1 have only shared the lot of all humanity’

⁷ 1f the unburied corpse speaks throughout (see Introd.) we notice
how the transition is prepared from his address to Archytas to his
appeal to the sailor. ‘Death claims all; the sea has its tribute

¹ ’ from the sailors who traverse it. I was not exempt from the law.

⁷ Do not you, a sailor like them and like me, sorget your common
mtggzlgtgi Orionis. Orion’s setting is a time proverbial for bad
weather, Od. 3. 27. 18, Epod. 15. 7, Virg. Aen. 7. 719.

comeo, Od. 4. 12. 1.

22. Illyricis, for the Adriatic generally, as Virg. Aen. 1. 243.
