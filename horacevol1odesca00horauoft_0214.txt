ODE IX ’

‘ ΙΤ is midwinter. Well, pile on more logs, and bring out larger ξ
supplies of wine. When the gods will, spring will come back..
Do not look forward. Each day that you get is so much gained. ⁷
Enjoy it. Love and dance and play while you can, for old age i.

them for spring. ξζ

ὕει μὲν ὁ Ζεύς, ἐκ δ’ ὀρανῶ μέγας
χειμών, πεπάγασιν δ’ ὑδάτων ῥοαί.

κάββαλλε τὸν χειμῶν’, ἐπὶ μὲν fleas·

μαλθακὸν ἄμφιτίθη γνόφαλλον. ἐξ

‘Thaliarchus' seems to be neither a real proper name, nor the j
title of an office, as though it were the same as συμποσίαρχος, but an ⁷
imaginary name, chosen or coined with a view to its etymological
meaning ‘prince of good cheer‚ 'and meant to describe the person
addressed as the representative of youth and merriment.
