THE ODES OF HORACE

25. cogimur, of gathering the flock to the sold, Virg3 E. 3. 98, 33
&e Cp. Od. 1. 24. 18‘ nigro compulerit Mercurius gregi. ἔ
26. urna, Od. 3. 1. 16‘ aequa lege Necessitas Sortitur insignes ¹;
et imos· ‚ Omne capax movet urna nomen? ξ
28. cumbae, dative after ‘impositura,’ ‘to place us on board ἔ
the bark for the banishment from which none returns.’ ‘ Cumba’ .“
is said to be the form preferred when the boat of Charon is meant. ⁷

ODE IV

‘No need to blush‚ Xanthias, though you love a slave girl. ’-
Achilles had his Briseis, and Ajax his Tecmessa; even Agamem-
non, the conqueror of Troy, could not withstand Cassandra. Who <
knows but Phyllis too is some born princess: one so constant and ε
so indifferent to money can spring from no vulgar stock. Nay,
don’t suspect my praises, Ι am close on fortyss ⁸

We can hardly be wrong in supposing that, with the exception j
of her pretty face and figure, the praises of Phyllis are meant to be j
interpreted ironically. The mock heroic tone of the list of pre·
cedents (cp. Od. 1. 16, Introd„ and Epod. 3), the ‘regium certe,’ ’
and the contempt implied for her real birth, ‘ scelesta plebe,' might
be merely playful ; but considering the topics of praise, ‘ sic fidelem, ἡ
sic lucro aversam,’ there is hardly feeling enough in their expression,
standing as they do between the levit-y of stanzas 4 and 6, to redeem
the playfulness from the sting of irony. ·

And possibly the Ode refers to some real person, although the Ξ
name be fictitious. The irony would be wasted on a shadow; and
there 1s a definiteness both m the name of the‘ Phocian’ Xanthias
and in the introduction of Horace’s own personality (stanza 6),
which is more dramatic than is usual in the purely imaginary
Odes.1t is undoubtedly H orace s way to add a local designation
to fictitious characters: ‘Cnidius Gyges,’ Od. 2. 5.2 ;‘Liparaei y
nitor Hebri, 3. 12. 6. In some case5‚ as in ‘Thurini0 Calais filius '.
Ornyti, 3. 9. 14, the appearance of complete identification is s
strongly in point, and in all the object probably was to give a {12¹
greater semblance of reality. The purpose here is the less easy ξ
to imagine, from the fact that the name is addressed to Xanthias ,
himself, not used by way of identifying him to others. If the lover ἒ
of the Ode was a real person, there may of course be some play in ,μ
the name, of which the point is lost to us. Orelli suggests that f
‘ Xanthias ’ may be chosen to cover a Roman ‘ FlaviuS,’ cp. Od. 3. ξ,
15. 11, where he thinks‘ Nothus’ may represent a real ‘Spurius.’ ³¹
Ritter imagines a Greek resident* m Rome, and, comparing Od. 1. ·
27.10 ‘Megillae frater Opuntiae, ingeniously suggests that the
person there rallied is none other than Xanthias, and that the ’

Phyllis’ of this Ode is the‘ Charybdis' of that.
