THE ODES OF HORACE

goes before the steps of Fortune 3 Doom, whose handiwork man can·
not undo.’ We want every word that we can spare to heighten the ζ’

picture of Doom. Her relation to Fortune is lightly passed over. ¹

molten lead, was used to join blocks of stone, such as the joints
of a column, Vitr. 2. 8. The implements which Necessitas carries ·
are all emblems of the fixity of her sentence. The point is not that
they are implements of building ,but that they are the implements
which make a building indissoluble. Others besides her may be

to Lessing’s Laocoon. It seemed to him an instance in which ’

poetry had suffered from inattention to the laws which distinguish
its functions from those of painting. It is a picture; the attributes
all appeal to the eye. In a painting or piece of sculpture they ,
would be all seen at a glance. The effort of mind required to v

comprehend them would be very small3 and in the meantime, ,
as ‘Necessitas' would be in itself merely an unnamed female ῙΞ
figure, they would be necessary symbols to convey the allegory ⁴1
to the spectator. It is different with the poet. The symbols are
not needed to interpret the personificafion, for he can yspeak the
terrible name of the power which he is perso-nifying. They need ’
interpretation themselves, and their accumulation wearieS‚ because, ”

though each costs a fresh effort to the mind, there is no corre-

sponding and distinct addition to the idea conveyed. What, when ''

we interpret it, is implied by the molten lead that was not also
implied by the nails? Few will dispute the main propositions of
Lessing's criticism; but we may notice that Horace does not leave
