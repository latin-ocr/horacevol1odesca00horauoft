BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE Ι, 1-9

language of a hierophant bidding the uninitiate avaunt at the com-
mencement of mysteries. We must not, however, look for the
metaphor in every word of the stanza. Itis the epithet ⁴ profanum '
that seems first to suggest it. As the mysteries are those of the
Muses, the vehicle of their proclamation will be ‘carmina.' The
audience are to be ‘ virgines puerique,' not because the chorus that
sang hymns in honour of a god (Carm. S. 6) must be so composed,
for this would be to introduce a second metaphor; but because it
was to the young and simple that the poet would address his pre-
cepts of moderate living, of courage‚ justice and piety. We seem
to have an echo, and an interpretation, of the imagery of this place
in Epp. 1. 19. 32 foll. ‘ Hunc [sc. Alcaeum] ego, non alio dictum
prius ore, Latinus Vulgavi fidicen. iuvat immemorata ferentem
Ingenuis oculisque legi manibusque teneri.' Verses 1, 2 contain the
two proclamations customary at solemn rites‚ the first to warn away
improper hearers, ἕκας ἔκας ὅστις ἀλιτρός, Callim. H. in Apoll. 2,
‘Procul O procul este profani,’ Virg. Aen. 6. 2583 the second
enjoining a sacred silence on those that remained, Arist. Thesm. 39
ευφημος πᾶς ἔστω λεώς, στόμα συγκλείσας, Tibull. 2-2. 1 ‘ Dicamus
bona verba. .Quisquis ades lingua vir mulierque fave,’ Virg. Aen.
5. 71 ‘Ore favete omnes) Cp especially Arist. Ran 353 foll.
Εὐφημεῖν χρὴ κάξίστασθαι τοις ἡμετέροισι χοροῖσιν, '⁰ οστις ἄπειρος
τοιῶνδε λόγων η γνώμῃ μὴ καθαρεύει, Ι η γενναίων οργια Μουσῶν μήτ’
εἶδεν μήτ’ ἐχόρευσεν κτλ.

2. non prius audita. The initiated are to receive a new revela-
tion. The metaphor‚ if we are to interpret it, would seem to include
the two ideas, that the Odes which follow are to be of a higher
mood than their predecessors‚ and that the wisdom which they
convey is strange to the age.

3. Musarum sacerdos, a natural description of a poet. Theoc.
16. 29 Μουσάων ἱεροὺς ὑποφῆτας, Virg. G. 2. 175 ‘ Musae quarum
sacra fero. ’

5. proprios, each over his own flock3 i. e. his sway is limited.

greges, because kings are ποιμένες λαῶν. For the construction

‘imperium est in greges' cp. 4. 4. 2 ‘regnum in avis: Orelli quotes
Plaut. Men. 5. 7. 11 ‘ Si quod' imperi est in te mihi.'
k 7,8 . ‘ Of Jove, whose glory and power dwarf those of the greatest
mgs?

8. supercilio, after Hom. ΙΙ. 1. 528⁹ η και κυανέῃσιν ἐπ’ ὀφρυσι
νεῦσε Κρονίων. ,μέγαν δ’ ἐλέλιξεν” Ολυμπον, Virg.Aen.1o. 115.

9—14. ‘Men may differ in fortune during life. One possesses
broad acres ; another, if he is a candidate for office, can offer high
birth ; a third is a “novus homo,” but has higher personal reputa-
ti0111<3 a fourth has a larger number of clients on whose votes he can
rec on.’

9. est ut, ‘it may be that,’ as ‘non est ut‚' Epp. 1. 12. 2. It is
needless with Bentley to alter to ‘esto.’ The concessions are

balanced in the apodosis ‘aequa lege‚’ διο.
viro vir, ‘man than man,’ but they do not thereby rise above
