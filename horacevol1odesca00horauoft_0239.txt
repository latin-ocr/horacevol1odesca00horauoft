the river is the ‘Tuscus alveus‚’ Od. 3. 7. 283 ‘Lydius Tibris,'
Virg. Aen. 2. 781. So that in the whole verse there is implied

1 reference to both topics of compliment, Maecenas' high birth and

his modest state. ‘ Maecenas, eques Etrusco de sanguine regum,
Intra fortunam qui cupis esse tuam,’ Prop. 3. 9. 1.

6. iocosa imago, see on Od. 1. 12. 3.

7. Vaticani. The theatre of Pompey, which was the only one
finished at this time, stood at the south end of the Campus Martius,
near the present church of S. Andrea della Valle, so looking across
the Tiber on the Janiculan and Vatican hills. Juvenal (6. 344)
llslngthelns the second syllable in Vaticanus, and he is followed by

artia .

9. Caecubum. The ‘Caecubus ager’ was a marshy tract on

·· the coast of Latium between Terracina and Formiae. The wines
· chosen to represent the finer Italian growths are two pairs of

neighbouring vintages, one pair in Latium, the Caecuban and

, Formian (Od. 3. 16. 34); the other in Campania, the F alemian
.. and the wine of Cales (Od. 1. 31. 9, 4. 12. 14).

' 10. tu bibes. It is easier to see the difficulty of this reading
than to convince oneself of the admissibility of any of the proposed
remedies. 1f it stands, it must mean, ‘I must leave you to drink,
sc. at home‚’ the future, as in Od. 1. 6. 1. There is undoubtedly

great awkwardness in the difference of sense which we are thus
⁵> obliged to put on the future here and in v. 1, ‘potabis’ Munro
2 (Journal of Philology, 1871, p. 350) proposed from the reading

‘ bides ’ (λ), to restore ‘vides’ in the sense of ‘you provide.' Cp.

· Cic. ad Att. 5. 1. 3 ‘ut prandium nobis videret,’ and Ter. Heaut.
ὲ , 3. 1. 49 ‘ Quid vini absumsit Ξ Sic hoc, dicens, asperum, Pater, hoc
” est: aliud lenius sodes vide: Relevi dolia omnia, omnis serias‚'

a passage which he thinks may have unconsciously suggested to

« Horace the ‘levi' of v. 3 as well as the ‘vides’ of this verse.

Keller has at different times suggested three modes of treatment.
In the Rhein. Mus. vol. xviii. p. 274 he supported ‘ Tu bibis‚' the
quantity as in ‘scribis,’ Sat. 2. 3. 1. In his own edition of 1864

’· he gave ‘Tum bibes,’ which is found in the best MSS. of the
’ scholia on Sat. 2. 2. 48 where the verse is quoted. He explained
· it (Rbein. Mus„ vol. xix. p. 212) to mean ‘Then‚ after the Sabine,

you shall have some Caecuban; I cannot give you Falernian.’
But the sense is dull, and it is hardly possible to doubt the anti-

³ thesis ‘Tu . . . mea.’ In the Epilegomena (1879) he suggested
³ ‘ Tu bibas' on the analogy of ‘ Premat Calena falce . . . me pascunt

olivae,’ thinking the subjunctive had been misunderstood and
assimilated by copyists to the fut. of ‘tu potabis.' lf any treat-
ment is needed, this is the simplest. In his last edition Keller
has returned to ‘tu bibes.’

11. temperant. Properly the man who mixes the wine and
water is said ‘temperare pocula.’ The vines and hills are here
stgid to do so because they produce the grapes which are used for

e purpose.
