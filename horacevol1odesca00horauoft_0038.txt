INTRODUCTION TO THE

are often used merely as poetical expressions of distance, the
extreme North (as in Od. 2. 20), or generally for the northern
tribeS, as the supposed representatives of the manlier virtues (as in
Od. 3. 24) or as the objects of the vague fears of Roman statesmen
(Οεὶ. 2. 11.1).

The Daci are mentioned by Dion 51. 22 as offering their services
to Octavianus, and when their terms were declined by him joining
Antony, to whom, however, they rendered little assistance, as they
were quarrelling amongst themselves (see Od.3.6. 13).

In B. C. 30, M. Crassus, at the bidding of Octavianus, marched
northward from Macedonia, and won some victories over the Daci
and Bastarnae as well as the Moesi, for which in B. c. 27 he was
allowed a triumph, Dion 51. 23.

From the Epitome of Livy (B. 135) it appears that Crassus was
again fighting in Thrace in B.c. 25.

Florus (4. 12, ξ 18) speaks of Lentulus driving the Daci beyond
the Danube, but no date is given. His words may be worth
quoting for his mention of Cotiso (Od. 3. 8. 18) and for the illus-
tration of Horace's expression ‘intra praescriptum equitare‚' od.
2. 9. 23: ‘Daci montibus inhaerent; Cotisonis¹ regis imperio
quotiens concretus gelu Danuvius iunxerat ripas decurrere solebant
et vicina populari. Visum est Caesari Augusto gentem aditu
difficillimam submovere. Misso igitur Lentulo ultra ulteriorem
repulit ripam: citra praesidia constituit, sic tunc Dacia non victa
sed submota atque dilata est. Sarmatae patentibus campis inequi-
tant3 et hos per eundem Lentulum prohibere Danuvio satis fuit!

It is obvious that there is nothing here to fix the date of the
debated Ode 3. 8. The victory of Crassus will satisfy the expres-
sions of v. 18, and so would the victory of Lentulus, but this last is
itself undated.

The Eastern Scythians are named by Justinus as interfering in
the quarrel between Phraates and Tiridates in Parthia (see the next
section). An embassy of Scythians is said by Orosius (see Introd.
to Od. 2. 11) to have come to Augustus while he was at Tarraco :in
Spain B. e. 25.

² Suetonius, Oct. 63, calls him ‘Getarum rex, and gives a story, on

Antony’s authority, of Augustus having at one time promised Julia in
marriage to him, and asked a daughter of his in return.
