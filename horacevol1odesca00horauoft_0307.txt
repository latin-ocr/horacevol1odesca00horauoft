aureo plectro. Φόρμιγγ’ Ἀπόλλων ἑπτάγλωσσον χρυσέῳ πλάκτρῳ
διώκων, Pind. N. 53 24. For‘ plectro’ see on 2. 1. 40. The
‘golden plectrum’ is significant of the value of the poems. Cp.
Quintil. 10. 1. 63 ‘Alcaeus in parte operis aureo plectro merito·
donatur qua tyrannos insectatus multum etiarn moribus confert, '
δὶς. On the subjects of his poems see Od. 1. 32.

27. dura navis, 1. 32. 7 ‘Sive iactatam religarat udo Litore

· ΠέῑνΙΠὶ.’

·.28 fugae, φυγῆς, ‘exiless

29. sacro silentio, i. e. of the silence with which divine rites are
received. Cp. 3. 1. 2 ‘Favete linguis: carmina . . . Musarum
sacerdos . . . canto.’ ⁷

30. magis, placed first as the antithesis to ‘ utrumque, ' and to be
taken with the whole ‘densum . . . vulgus' they crowd more
thickly, and drink every word more greedily‚ where Alcaeus is singing.

31. tyrannos. Myrsilus, &c.

32. densum umeris, ‘pressing shoulder to shoulder? ‘Haeret
·pede pes densusque viro vir, 'Virg. Aen. 10. 361.

bibit aure = ‘avide audit,’ Aer. The sounds are poured, not as
into ζ cup which receives passively, but as into the drinker's
mout .

33. illis carminibus, ablative with ‘ stupenS,’ as Sat. 1. 4. 28,
2. 2. 5. Sappho's singing is included as well as that of Alcaeus.
Compare with these stanzas Od. 3. 11. 13-24, Virg. G. 4. 481—484.

34. demittit auris, contrast Epod. 6. 7 ‘aure sublata,’ of a
bound on the scent.

centiceps, posszbly to be explained by 3. 11. 16‘ Cerberus, quam—
vis furiale centum Muniant angues caput eius,’ since the expression

‘ore trilingui' (cp. 2. 19. 31) m the same place seems to imply that
there the picture is of three heads. Sophocles calls Cerberus -Αιδου
τρίκρανον σκύλακα, Trach. 1098, Hesiod Ἀίδεω κύνα χαλκεόφωνον
πεντηκοντακάρηνον, Theog. 312 3 Pindar, acc. to Interpr. Ven. on
Hom. 11. 8. 368 ἐκατοντακάρηνον. These epithets may imply in the
Greek poets real variety of imagination ; but in a Roman poet they
are echoes, and there is nothing therefore to prevent Horace giving
Cerberus his Sophoclean form in one Ode and his Pindaric comple—
ment of heads in another, as Virgil speaks at one time with t'he
Greek tragedians of ‘agmina Eumenidum,' at another with the
Alexandrines of Megaera, Allecto, and Tisiphone. For a still more
pertinent instance see Conington on Virg. Aen. 6. 287 as compared
with 10. 565, and 6. 605 compared with 12. 845.

35. Aesch. Cho. 1049 πεπλεκτανημέναι πυκνοῖς δράκουσιν, Virg. G.
4. 482‘ implexae crinibus angues Eumenides!

36. recreantur, ‘take rest.²
37. Prometheus. This form of the legend, which makes Pro—

metheus still undergo punishment in Tartarus (cp. Od. 2. 18. 35,
Epod. 17. 67), is known to no other extant author.
