21. civis. The purpose for which the sword is sharpened, is

indicated partly by the contrasted‘ better' purpose, partly by the
emphasis on ‘civis’ ; not as soldiers‚ nor as Romans against

- foreignerS, butas citizens, in pursuance of an intestine, civil quarre13

see on Od. 1. 32. 5, and 1. 35. 34. Compare the use of ‘ soror' in

Virg. Aen. 12. 871.
22. Cp. the opening of Lucan’s Pharsalia, esp. v. 10 foll. ‘Cu-m

Persae. From the decline of the Syro—Macedonian kingdom,

ε of Artaxerxes, the founder of the Sassanidae, A.D. 226, the ruling

where chey adopted the pomp and title of the old Persian monarchs,
Βασιλεὺς βασιλέων, βασιλεὺς μέγας. Horace is the only Augustan
writer who calls them ‘ Persae' (and therefore, following the Greek
usage, also ‘ Medi ’3 see below, v. 51), an instance probably of the
predominant influence of Greek associations upon his style. Cp.
the still more definite identification of the two dynasties, Od. 2.

24. rara, ‘our youth scant in number for their parents’ crimes.’

it contains more definitely the idea of the dominion of Rome over
foreign peoples, 3. 5. 4, ‘ adiectis Britannis Imperio’3 cp. the verb
in 3. 6. 5 ‘Dis te minorem quod geris imperas [Romane].’ 4. 15.

perium cubile ’ seems to combine both shades of meaning.

27. minue audientem, ‘turning a deas ear to their litanies.’

Vesta is represented as offended at the murder of the Pontifex

Maximus, whose office was specially connected with her service
and temple, see above, v. 16. Ordinarily she would be the pro-

tectress of Rome.

· 29. scelus, ἅγος, guilt which involves ceremonial pollution. Cp.
