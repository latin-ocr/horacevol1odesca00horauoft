BOOK IV, ODE VI, 29——ODE vn, 13

in Epp. 1. 5, to much the same purpose as in this Ode; but more
than that it is difficult to say, notwithstanding the many guesses
that have been offered on the subject. The two most plausible
ones are, (1) that of Estre, who identifies with him the Aulus Tor-
quatus mentioned in Corn. Nep. Atticus, as amongst those who
were compromised by their share in Brutus and Cassius' campaign.
This would give an occasion for Horace’s acquaintance with him.
(2) That of Weichert, who thinks that he was no member of the
Manlia gens, but the C. Nonius Asprenas mentioned by Suetonius
(Oct. 43 and 56), the intimate friend of Augustus, who had assumed
for himself and his family the cognomen of Torquatus by permission
of the emperor, and in memory of a golden‘ torques' with which
Augustus had presented him on the occasion of his injuring himself
by a fall while performing m the Ludus Trozae. His assumption of
the name has been held to prove, what there are no other facts to
disprove‚ that the old family of Torquati was extinct.

The Ode is remarkably parallel to 1. 4; so much so, that
Macleane 15 inclined to think that it was omitted on this account
from the first three Books‚ and only published under the necessity
of making up a respectable number to meet Augustus’ requirement
of a fourth Book. There is nothing to indicate its date.

hl. diffugere, ‘like an army defeated,’ as Wordsworth para-
p rases it.

3. mutat vioes==‘ vices patitur,’ ‘peragitss Ov. Met. 15. 238: but

‘mutat' emphasizes the complete change which happens, vices’

(cp.‘ grata vice,’ 1. 4. 1, ‘benigna vice, '.Epod 13. 8) the orderly
succession of the conditions.

terra is probably the‘ dry land‚’ in which case ‘mutat terra
vices ’ sums up the changes of the two preceding lines, as the next
line and a half deal with the ‘ streams.'

4. praetereunt, ‘flow past (i. e. within) their banks,‘ instead of
pouring over them.

5. Gratia. cum geminis sororibus, i.e. the three Graces. For
the form cp.3.19. 16. For the Graces dancing as a picture of
returning spring, 1. 4. 6

7. annus et. .diem, the revolution of the year, and the
rapidity with which sunny days fly past us. ‘,Hora’ not so much
the evening hour (which would be to introduce a new image) as
the ssight of time, the passing hours. Cp. 2. 16 32.1t is not
night, but winter which he sees approaching.

9. Compare the procession of the seasons in Lucr. 5. 736.

proterit, καταπατεῖ, ‘tramples before it,' of the advance of a
victorious army; 3. 5. 34.

11. effuderit, ‘has scattered broadcastl

13. damna. .oae1estia‚ ‘all that 15 lost m heaven’· primarily
of the waning of the moon itself, ‘ damna' being commonly used' in
this sense by Manilius and others; but we are to understand also
the whole waste and damage of the year as it passes back into
