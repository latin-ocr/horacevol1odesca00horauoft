BOOK ΙΙΙ, ODE IV, 1-10

the Muses’ voice, though you do not. I have been their favourite
from my baby hood. ‘

fabulosae, ‘’;legendary ‘de quibus fabulantur poetae! They
are the birds of Venus that draw her car3 they carry ambrosia
to Zeus himself (Hom. Od. 12. 62). The suggestion is that their
action in covering the child· -poet in leaves was, like their actions of
which legends tell, ‘non sine Dis’; and, as Conington remarks,
the emphatic conjunction ‘ me fabulosae,' διε. is as much as to say,
⁶1, too, like other poets (as Stesichorus, Pindar, Aeschylus), have
a legend of my infancy.’

Vultur-e (see footnote on p. 15), now Monte Vulture, a mountain,
originally volcanic‚ 4363 feet high, near the point where Apulia,
Samnium, and Lucania join. As it is some ten miles to the
west of Venusia, we are to imagine Horace as, at the time of
the incident, in ‘villeggiatura’ in the hius, perhaps at his nurse’s
cottage.

10. extra limen Apuliae. This is the reading of the great
number of MSS„ and apparently was found by Aer. and Porph.
It is usually interpreted of part of the Mons Vultur, just beyond the
border line. Horace dwells on the character of the neighbourhood
as ‘debateable land’ on the frontier of the two provinces, Sat.
2. 1. 34 ‘ Lucanus an Apulus anceps,' &c. There is, however, some
reason sor suspecting that this reading was an early corruption.
The minuteness of the local description and its paradoxical form
have no special point; and the instances quoted from other poets
of variation of the quantity in such names as Italus, Italia; Priamus,
Priamides; Sicanus‚ &c. are hardly parallel to the inversion of the
quantity of two syllables in the same word, in the same part of two
consecutive lines. It is doubtful, besides, whether the Roman
poets ever shortened the first syllable of Apulia. The only instance
alleged is the ‘mare Apulicum' of 3. 24. 4, where the reading is at
least as doubtful as the present one. Meanwhile, of the oldest MSS.
B and three others have ‘limina Pullie,’ and the Scholiast on γ
reads the same, and explains it as the proper name of the nurse.
Acr. and Porph. seem to have read ‘Apuliae,' but, oddly, to have
interpreted it in the same way: ‘ F abulosam nutricem appellavit
quod hae fere alumnis suis narrare fabulas solent. Extra limen
fabulosae Apuliae meae nutricis. Provinciae nomen posuit pro
nutricis‚’ Acr. So also on v. 19, Aer. ‘ extra casae limen.’ ⁴ Pollia’
or ‘Pullia' is a name that occurs in several inscriptions. It is
barely possible then that we have here the name of Horace’s nurse,
although it cannot be thought likely that none of his readers and
imitators in antiquity should have preserved her memory. It is
possible, again, that the word which completed the verse may have
been lost early, the copyist’s eye being caught by the conclusion
of the preceding verse3 and it may have been some adjective
such as ‘’sedulae (Bentl.) agreeing with‘ nutricis! Itis possible,
Ritter thinks, that ‘Apuliae’ was a gloss to explain some other
name of the district, such as ‘Dauniae’
