BOOK 11, ODE 111, 25—ODE IV, 17

The composition of the Ode is fixed by v. 24 to the end of
Horace’s fortieth year, B.c. 25.

1. Ne sit. See on Od. 1. 33. 1.

2. prius, ‘before you,' ‘you are not the first!

insolentem, according to the character assigned to him in A. P.
122 ‘ Iura neget sibi nata, nihil non arroget armis ’3 so he was less
likely to stoop to a slave girl. Notice the antithetical placing of
the words throughout, ‘insolentem serva‚’ ‘ captivae dominum‚’
‘fessis leviora,' ‘Pergama Grais!

6. Tecmessae. Orelli recalls Soph. Aj. 211 ἐπεί σε λέχος δουριά-
λωτον Ι στέρξας ἀνέχει θούριος Αἴας. Tecmessa is unknown to Homer.

7. arsit. There seems to be a play in the word, ‘ He was fired
by her as he had fired Troy’ ; cp. Epod. 14. 13 ‘ si non pulchrior
ignis Accendit obsessam Ilion!

8. rapta, ‘ captive.' Hom. 11. 22. 62 υἷάς τ’ ὀλλυμένους ἑλκηθείσας
τε θύγατρας. Compare the scene in Virg. Aen. 2. 403 foll. ‘Ecce
trahebatur passis Priameia Virgo Crinibus a templo Cassandra,’
διε. There is an antithesisbetween ‘ medio in triumpho ’ and ‘ vir-
gine rapta ’ ; ‘ capta victorem cepit.’ It is this feeling which gives
its point to the next stanza. ‘ When the warriors had fallen and
the citadel of Troy was an easy prey to its foes, then a captive maid

vanquished the great conqueror.’

’ 9. barbarae. See on Epp. 1. 2. 7, and Epod. 9. 6.

10. Thessalo, as in Od. 1. 10. 15 ‘ Thessalos ignis‚’ i.e. the
watch-fires of Achilles. ,

victore, the abl. absol.; see on 1. 6. 1 and 2. 1. 12.

ademptus Hector, cp. 1. 37. 13 ‘ minuit furorem Vix una sospes
navis,’ but the construction which attributes the action more person·
ally to Hector is intentionally chosen‚ as though by his death he was
the very traitor who opened the walls of Troy to the foe. Cp. Virg.
Aen. 4. 17 ‘ Postquam primus amor deceptam morte fefellit.’

11. fessis, Virg. Aen. 2. 108 foll. It gives the sense'of ‘ at last,‘
when the obstacles to victory had been overcome. The dative goes
· grammatically either with ‘ tradidit ' or with ‘leviora tolli‚’ in feeling
with the latter; for the constr. ‘leviora tolli‚' see App. 2, ξ 2.

leviora, perhaps with a remembrance of Hom. Il. 22. 287 καί
κεν ἐλαφρότερος πόλεμος Τρώεσσι γένοιτο Ι σεῖο καταφθιμένοιοζ but
⁴ leviora ⁹ and ‘ tolli ’ probably match and make one metaphor.

ὑ 13. nescias an, an extension of the common ‘nescio an’ in its
·- Ciceronian sense, ‘I am not sure, but nearly so.’ ‘ You may be
pretty sure auburn Phyllis has parents among the great,' &c.

15. regium genus, after ‘maeret.’ ‘ Her tears are surely for
some royal ancestry and the unkindness of her home gods,' who
suffered her to fall in the world.

17. de plebe, a tertiary predicate with delectam. ‘ Believe that
in her thou hast not chosen one from the rabble crowd.' Bentley
accepts ‘dilectam’ of a good many MSS. as=‘selectam.’ It is
true that here, as often, though not always, ‘diligere’ retains its
