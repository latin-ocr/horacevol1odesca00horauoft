EPODE XIV, 6—EPODE XVI

ιι. mea virtute. Orelli and Dillr. take this as merely = ‘per
mest But there seems an intended play in ‘virtute . . . viri,' cp.
Epod. 16. 39, &c. ‘quibus est virtuS, muliebrem tollite luctum.⁷
His special ‘manly’ virtue will be ‘constantia.’ It might have
been her happiness, it shall be her punishment.

14. et, after a negative clause, where we expect rather an adver-
sative conj., as in Virg. Aen. 2. 94 ‘ N ec tacui demens et . . . promisi.'
See on Od. 1. 27. 16.

parem, ‘ a true match,‘ one faithful like myself.

15, 16. ‘ Nor will my resolution yield to beauty which has once
become odious to me, if the pain has once entered and fixed itself
in my heart.'

15. offensae, literally, ‘ which 1 have stumbled against ’ : so
Cicero uses it, pro Sest. 58. 125 ‘ cui nos offensi invisique fuerimus.’

16. dolor, the pain of feeling deserted.

19. Licebit, with very little difference from ‘licet,’ ‘although,’
were when, as in Sat. 2. 2. 59 ‘licebit Ille repotia . . . celebret . . .
instillat,’ the main verb is in the present tense.

d 21. aroana, esoteric doctrines, taught only to a few favoured Q
isci les.

regati, Od. 1. 28. 10, referring to his doctrine of μετεμψύχωσις.
