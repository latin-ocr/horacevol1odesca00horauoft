BOOK ΙΠ, ODE XXVI, 7—ODE XXVII, 11

1. parrae. Probably the common owl, called still in local Italian
dialects ‘ parruzza.'

recinentis, repeating its note; 1. 12. 3, Epp. 1. 1. 55.

2. ducat, πέμποι, ‘go with them on their way‚’ i.e. attend their
Setting forth. The talk is of ἐνόδιοι σύμβολοι, Aesch. P. V. 487.

3. rava, ‘ ravus color dicitur niger mixtus cum fulvo,' Acr.

decurrens Lanuvino. Lanuvium, now Civita Lavinia, was on
a hill about a mile to the right of the Via Appia (cp. Cic. pro Mil.
5.10), by which Galatea is starting‚ like Horace in Sat. 1. 5, for
Brundisium and the passage to Greece.

5. rumpat et. There is no inconsistency, as Bentley objects,
between the wishes of the first and second stanzas. They are really
alternatives, thoug'h put, after a common fashion, conjunctively‚
like the Homeric ειθ’ ὄφελες ἄγονός τ’ ἔμεναι ἄγαμός τ’ ἀπολέσθαι : see
on 3. 11. 49. ‘ Let evil omens attend the setting forth, or stop the

journey of the wicked! Both things may happen to them, though -

not to the same people on the same occasion. ⁴ I,’ he continues, ‘if
with my knowledge of augury I am anxious for a friend, will at least
do my best to procure good omens for her. Go, Galatea, where
you like best, and good omens go with you.' Munro follows Bentley
in adopting the reading ‘rumpit,’ which is found in some of the
good MSS. This alteration gives a different colour to the whole
passage. All three stanzas will then, though under varied forms,
be really direct statements of the omens which stop, or ought to
stop, persons from setting out on a journey. ‘ Only those who think
nothing of religion would start in spite of the hooting of an owl (the
form is optative or permissive, ‘let the omen of an owl, &c. go with
the wicked )': even if the Journey is begun, it is broken off if a snake
darts across the road. I shall pray, when Iam anxious for a friend’ s
safety‚ for the omen of a croaking crow in the east, instead of that
of the raven flying away to the pools.’ The transition from this to
stanza 4 is very awkward, unless, with Bentley and Munro, we
complete the sense by adopting, in v. 15, the conjecture of Lambi-
nus, ‘vetat ' ; so that it will mean, ‘in your case, Galatea, there are
none of these bad omens. ’ The ‘ que' in v. 15 is awkward in that
case, and the direct enumeration of the omens must have owed its
point, if it had any, to circumstances which we do not know.
d 7. eui timebo, ‘ for one for whom'; the dative has to do double
uty.
8. providus auspex. He will not only wait for the omens and

' judge them when they come, but will look forward to them, and try

to procure good ones.

10. imbrium divina. avis, as 3.17.12 ‘ aquae augur annosa
cornix,’ of the same bird. Both‘ stantis paludes’ and ‘vaga' seem
to refer to the same sign of bad weather as that mentioned by Virg.
G. 1. 388 ‘Tum cornix plena pluviam vocat improba voce Et sola
in sicca secum spatiatur harena? Horace will pray that the omen
of good weather may anticipate and prevent the omen of bad.

11. oscinem, t‘o give an omen by its voice,’ according to the

211 P2
