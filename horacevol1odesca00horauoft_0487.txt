2. vSersiculos, ²{he diminutive gives a touch of ironical contempt,

amore percussum, probably a reminiscence of Lucretius, 1. 922

‘acri Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor, Et simul in-
cussit suavem mi in pectus amorem Musarum,’ coloured perhaps
by Virgil’ s imitation, G. 2. 476‘ ingenti percussus amore' ; so that
‘amore,’ made emphatic by its repetition, and explained in v. 4,
hias the force of a ‘ passion, vehement and irresistible, but not for
t e Muses.’

6. honorem decutit, Od. 1. 17. 16 ‘ Ruris honorum,' Virg. G. 2.
404 ‘Frigidus et silvis Aquilo decussit honorem,' see Conington's
note there. Servius says that that line is borrowed from Varro
Atacinus ; if so, Horace may have taken it from the same source.

7. nam pudet, the reason for his exclaiming ‘heu me,’ &c.‚ no:

13. calentis, the genitive depends on ‘arcana, ’ ‘ had stirred from
their concealment my secrets as Ι grew warm w’ith stronger wine!

inverecundus, ‘ destroying bashfulness.'

15-18. This is a continuation of Horace’ s own speech, begun m
v. 11. ‘Well, if only she angers rne a little more you shall hear
nothing further of these complaints. I will give up a struggle with
rivals who are not worthy of me)

16. libera. bilis, ‘liberrima indignatio,’ Epod.4. 10. ‘If my
anger once boil up and find vent?

17. fomenta,‘ useless bandages which give no ease to the ach—
ing wound,’ i. e. such complaints as he has been uttering. The
gase requires more trenchant treatment. It is a τομῶν πῆμα (Soph.
