BOOK ΙΙ, ODE XV, 12—ODE XVI, 17

Grosphus is doubtless the person whom Horace commends to
Iccius in Epp. 1. 12. 22-24 :—

‘Utere Pompeio Grospho et, si quid petet, ultro
defer3 nil Grosphus nisi verum orabit et aequum.
vilis amicorum est annona bonis ubi quid deest?

We gather from this Ode that he was a man of wealth, and, from
both Ode and Epistle, that his property was in Sicily.

1. Cp. 1. 1. 15 foll. ‘Luctantem Icariis fluctibus Africum Mer-
cator metuens otium et oppidi Laudat rura sui; mox reficit ratis,’ ν
&c. The application of the first six lines is allegorical‚ although by
the construction of v. 7 it is purposely made to appear that the
‘otium’ for which the trader and the Thracian sigh is the same
which is the true subjectos the Ode. ‘ The trader prays for [bodily]
rest, but it is only in the moment of storm3 the Thracian, the
Mede—but their hearts are in war; we too wish for rest [of mindJ,
but spend our lives in the cares and hurry which banish it!

2. prensus, καταληφθείς, apparently a technical word for ‘ caught
in a storm,' as ‘deprensus,' Virg. G. 4. 421.

3. certa, ‘on which to rely‚’ not as though there were some stars
-‘ certa, ' others ‘ incerta. ’

5. b'ello furiosa, Ἀρειμανής, ‘Mavortia tellus,’ Virg. Aen. 3. 13.

6. pharetra. decori. Their very adornment belies their prayer.

7. Grosphe. The personal address serves to point the separation
of the allegory from its application: ‘for rest, GrosphuS, —rest,
which gems, &c., will not buy!

non venale, οὐκ ὠνητόν, Thuc. 3. 40, &c. For the division of the
word between the two verses see Od. 1. 2. 20, 1. 2 5. 1 1.

10. summovet, the proper word of a lictor clearing the way for
the consul, ‘i‚ lictor, summove turbam,' Liv. 3. 48, διε. ‘The
tumults,’ of the mind is a continuation of the metaphor.

1 1. Cares are represented as a flock of ill-omened birds or harpies
that fly round and round under the panelled roof of the rich man’s
hall.

ornament of the modest board,’ perhaps also like the epithets
‘,purum’ ‘puri, 'it implies cleanliness. ‘Iamdudum splendet focus
