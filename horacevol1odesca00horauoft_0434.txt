THE ODES OF HORACE

winter. With the whole thought cp. Catull. 5. 4 ‘ Soles occidere et

redire possunt: Nobis cum semel occidit brevis lux, Nox est per-

petua una dormienda. ⁹

15 pius The variant ‘pater' has but slight MS. authority,
though it was found m V. The argument that‘ pius’, as the more
habitual Virgilian epithet, is the more likely to have been sub-
stituted can hardly weigh against a consensus of the best MSS.
The MSS. also vary between the order‘ Tullus dives' and‘ dives
Tullus.' The epithet is intended, probably, for both kings, princely

wealth being part of the traditions of the monarchy. The general ,
expression (cp. Epp. 1. 6. 27 ‘ Ire tamen restat Numa quo devenit ,

et Ancus ’) is after Lucr. 3. 1037 ‘Lumina sis oculis etiam bonus
Ancus reliquit,' that being from Ennius, Ann. 150.

16. pulvis et umbra, the conjunction perhaps from Soph. El.
1158 ἀντὶ φιλτάτης Ι μορφῆς σποδόν τε καὶ σκιὰν ἀνωφελῆ.

17. adiciant, ‘ may be adding‚' in their counsels.

hodiernae summae, the total (of our life) as it stands to-day.
V, with several other MSS„ had ‘vitae' instead of ‘summae,'
which can hardly be anything but a gloss. For ‘ summae ' in this
connexion cp. 1. 4. 15.

19. manus avidas heredis; the Epicurean moral of the Ode—
though it comes incidentally—‘ enjoy, do not hoard? Newman
remarks on this and similar expressions (as 2. 3. 20, 2. 14. 25), that

the state of feeling which they indicate belongs to the avoidance of =

marriage, which was a feature of Roman life at the time. ‘Amico
dare animo’ is apparently a translation of φίλῃ ψυχῇ χαρίζεσθαι =

‘genio indulgere'· Simonides, §8 5 enforcing the same lesson from
the shortness of life, σὺ ταῦτα μαθὼν βιότου ποτὶ τέρμα Ι ψυχῇ τῶν
ἀγαθῶν τλῆθι χαριζόμενος.

21. splendida. The magnificence‚ stateliness, of Minos’ court
is transferred to the decrees he passes. Homer describes him
Od. 11. 568 Διὸς ἀγλαὸν υἱόν, Ι χρύσεον σκῆπτρον ἔχοντα, θεμιστεύοντα
νέκυσσιν.

23. Torquate. The personal address implies that Torquatus
possesses the gifts of which Horace speaks. With ‘facundia’

Orelli compares the hint in Epp. 1. 5. 9, ‘Moschi causam, ’that ’

Torquatus was a forensic orator.
25—28. Two instances, from mythology, of the irrevocable nature

of death. The emphatic words are ‘pudicum’ and‘ caro,’ and
there 15 3 certain antithesis between the two stories. Hippolytus,

innocent and the victim of his chastity—yet Diana, the goddess of -

chastity, could not save him; Pirithous the guilty one of the pair
(see 3. 4. 79)—Theseus’ love made him share Pirithous’ enterprise‚
and for a time he shared his punishment3 but when he was set free
himself by Hercules, all his love could not free Pirithous also. In
the story of Hippolytus as told by Virg. Aen. 7. 765 foll. and Ov.
Met. 15. 479 foll„ Diana’s efforts are successful, for he is the person
whom Aesculapius recalled to life ; but this is unknown to the
r(13reelfz legend as it appears in Euripides' Hippolytus, which Horace
ere ollows.
