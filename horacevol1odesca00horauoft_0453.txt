especlally the second one: it was ‘ glorious, ' and it was a ‘ coveted
distinction' ‘'added (for the use of‘ arrogavit' cp. Epp. 2. 1. 35)
to what had gone before. That ‘imperiis’ refers to ‘past cam· ,
paignsf not to the commands of Augustus, which have been
successfully carried out in this one, is evident from what follows.
The succeeding stanzas are expansions of‘ peracta imperia?

41. Cantaber, see Introd. to Books 1-iii, 1. §6.

42. Medus, the Parthians; 4. 15. 6, Epp. 1. 18. 56.

(Mon. Ancyr. c. 31) claims to have received more than once em-
bassies from India. See also on Od. 2. 9. 23, 3. 29. 28.

is an abiding presence of protection.

problem (Herod. 2. 28) ; but the position of the copulatives seems
to show that the Danube is included. Herodotus (2. 33) imagines
it to be the exact counterpart of the Nile, and the correspondence
was extended by others to this special point. Sen. Ouaest. Nat. 4.
1 ‘Danuvium (Nilo) similem natura philosophi tradiderunt, quod et
fontis ignoti et aestate quam hieme maior sit, 'Auson Epigr. 4. 1

‘Danuvius penitis caput occultatus in oris) The rivers stand for
their respective countries—Egypt, Dacia, Armenia (Epp.1. 12. 26).
The force of the epithet‘ qui celat‚’ &c., is to point the distance to
which Augustus' rule extends. It spreads up rivers whose source
no traveller has explored.

47. beluosus; 3. 27. 26‘ scatentem Beluis pontum! Cp. 1. 3.
18. The adjective is found in no other good author. There is
possibly real reference in this case to the whales of the northern
seas. Britain was not in the reign of Augustus in any sense re—
duced, but the princes of different tribes had sent embassies to him
with presents and professions of friendship3 Strabo, 4. 5. 3.

493 non paventis funera3 Caes. B. G. 6. 14, Lucan. 1. 454⁴ quos
ille timorum Maximus haud urget, leti metus: inde ruendi In ferrum
mens prona viris animaeque capaces Mortis et ignavum rediturae
parcere vitae.' The variant‘ paventes' is found in a few MSS.
It is preferred by Bentley, on the ground that the variety‘ Galliae
(plur. nom. as in Suet. Jul. 49 ‘Gallias Caesar subegit, and com-
monly) non paventes, duraeque tellus 1beriae,’ is more Horatian
than two genitives dependent on ‘’telluS.
