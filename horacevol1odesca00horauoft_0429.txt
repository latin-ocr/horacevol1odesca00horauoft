the Persians, who, according to Herodotus (1. 133), deliberate
on every important matter twice, μεθυσκόμενοι and νήφοντες.

ODE VI

‘APOLLQ terrible to thine enemies, as Niobe, Tityos, and great
Achilles felt3 yet even in thy wrath the friend of Rome, for if
Achilles had lived Troy would have perished, not, indeed, by
treachery, but in open war, which would have left no remnant
to fly to Italy3 Apollo, whom we know teaching the cithara on
Parnassus, and bathing thy looks in the Xanthus ;—uphold to-day
the honour of the Daunian Muse. Aye, it is Apollo that inspires,
teaches, selects me. Listen to me, boys and maidens of the
chorus 3 take time from me, as you sing in turn Apollo and Diana
and their kindly offices to man. Some day the matron will tell
her children proudly “when the last Ludi Saeculares were held,

I ισοξ my part in thern, and sang the strains which the poet Horace

The Ode is, on the face of it, a sort of prelude to the Carmen
Saeculare; a poetical expression of the pride of the poet in his
selection to write the Hymn, and of his anxiety that it may receive
justice in its public performance. His professed purpose is to
claim the good offices first of Apollo, the powerful god to whose

1. Apollo is invoked first by virtue of his sternet attributes as an
avenger of ὕβρις. Three instances are given from mythology
(according to the well-known formula of Greek poetry), the last
being skilfully turned into a glorification of him as a θεὸς σωτήρ,
the saviour of the Aeneadae, whose inveterate foe he thus removed.

magnae linguae, ‘a vaunting tongue’ ; Soph. Ant. 127 Ζεὺς γὰρ
μεγάλης γλώσσης κόμπους Ι ὑπερεχθαζρει. The boast of Niobe was
that she had given birth to more children than Latona. The story
is told in Hom. Il. 24. 602.

2. vindicem is grammatically limited to the first clause by its
connexion with the genitive ‘linguae’ ; but to be extended in sense
to the other two, the kind of ὕβρις, of which he was the avenger,
being expressed in the first by the epithet of ‘Tityos raptor,' in
the second by the fuller account of Achilles’ bearing towards the

an assaudt on Latona, and his punishment 1n Tartarus, are told 1n
Hom. O . 11. 576.
