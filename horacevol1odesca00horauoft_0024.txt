GENERAL INTRODUCTION

references to Priscian (fifth century) on Epp. 2. 1. 228, and to
Priscian's teacher Theoctistus on Sat. 1. 5. 97. 1t is mainly on
those grounds that Keller distinguishes the Acron who was one of
the commentators used by Porphyrion from the composer or com-
posers of the Scholia which now bear the name, and which were
composed by some one who had Porphyrion's commentary in his
hands and used it largely. These Pseudo-Acronian Scholia he
relegates to the fifth century. Upon grounds on which it is less ,
easy to feel secure in following him, he divides them into two parts;
the first (up to the beginning of the Fourth Book of the Odes with
part of those in the Fourth Book and most of the Epodes) belong-
ing to the earlier half of the century; the remainder he places in
the second half, and identifies as their author Fabius Planciades
Fulgentius, a grammarian of that date, one of whose works, three
books of mythology, is found with no mark of a new author on the
same MS. with the Schol. Acron.

The so·called ‘ Commentator Cruquianus ’ is not an independent
authority, the name being given to a medley of notes, in the main
a transcript or paraphrase of Acron and Porphyrion, printed by
Cruquius from marginal or interlinear annotations on his Blandi·

nian MSS.

chronological list of the chief editions of Horace earlier than the ῃ
present century (chiefly from Mitscherlich).

Fifteentk century.

The ‘editio princeps' is not certainly known: the title is usually ’

given to an edition without name or date, which is supposed to
have been published by Zarotus at Milan in 1470. The first
edition, which contains a commentary by a modern scholar of
name, is that of Landinus (Cristoforo Landino, born at F lorence
1424, died 1504), printed at F lorence in 1482, and at Venice
in the same year. An edition, published at Venice in 1492,
contained, besides, notes by Mancinellus (Antonio Mancinelli‚
born at Velletri in 1452, a teacher of Orvieto).
