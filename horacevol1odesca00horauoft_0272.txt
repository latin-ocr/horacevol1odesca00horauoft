THE ODES OF HORACE

246 ‘creta an carbone notati.’ Horace is referring to what was
doubtless merely a proverbial mode of expression among the Romans.
Pliny attributes it as an actual custom to a Thracian tribe, ‘quae
calculos colore distinctos pro experimento cuiusque diei in urnam
condit ac supremo die separatos dinumerat atque ita de quoque

‘ pronunciat‚' N. H. 7. 40. The Latin poets are full of allusions to

such a fancied symbolic practice. Cp. Mart. 12. 34 (where he is
reviewing his thirty-four years of intercourse with his kinsman
Jul. Martialis) ‘Quarum dulcia mixta sunt amaris, Sed iucunda
tamen fuere plura: Et si calculus omnis huc et illuc Diversus
bicolorque digeratur Vincet candida turba nigriorem.' For briefer
references, Catull. 68. 148 ‘ Quem lapide illa diem candidiore notat ’;
106. 6 ‘ O lucem candidiore nota ' ; Pers. 2. 1 ‘ Hunc Macrine diem
numera meliore lapillo.² Some early critics altered ‘ Cressa’ to
‘Thressa‚' on the ground apparently of the story in Pliny. The
Schol. justify ‘ Cressa’ by relating the same story of the Cretans;
but, as Bentley remarked, whether they were Thracians or Cretans
they used black stones as well as white, so that the epithet would
not imply the colour of the stone to be used.

11. promptae, pred„ the wine jar must be brought out (‘ cellis
depromere avitis‚' Od. 1. 37. 5), and when brought there must be no
stint of it.

12. Cp. 1. 37. 1 ‘pede libero Pulsanda tellus.’ The words morem
in Salium oceur again in Od. 4. 1. 28. ‘ Salium ’ may be the gen.‚
as ‘ Boeotum,’ Ep. 2. 1. 244, or more probably the accus, of the
adj. ‘ Salius,' which occurs in Fest., and which Horace (see on od.
1. 15. 10) would have been ‘likely to prefer to the longer ‘ Saliaris:
Dancing was a part of the ceremonies observed by the Salii in the
festival of Mars (Liv. 1. 20), and according to Ovid (F ast. 3. 387
‘ a saltu nomina ducta ⁹) was the origin of their name.

13. multi meri, imitated by Ovid, Met. 14. 252 ‘multique Elpe-
nora vini.' .Cic. ad Fam. 9. 26, describes a man as ‘hospes non
multi cibi, sed multi ioci! It is an extension of the descriptive
gen. ⁴ pusilli animi‚’ &c., Madv. ξ 287, with obs. 3. Bassus, whose
usual character is clearly intended to contrast with that of Damalis
in this respect, is on this occasion to rival her in taking deep
draughts of wine, ἀμυστί, i. e. without closing the mouth = ἀπνευστί.

14. Bassum. The Roman name almost implies that a real
person is intended. There was a Bassus a poetical friend of Ovid
(Trist. 4. 10. 47), and one (or two) contemporary with Cicero; but
none is known to us whose date would well suit this reference. By
Martial's time the name has from this passage become proverbial
for a hard drinker (Mart. 6. 69).

Threicia, cp. Callim. Fr. 109 καὶ γὰρ ὁ Θρηῖκίην μὲν ἀπέστυγε χάνδον ³-
ὅμυστιν ζωροποτεῖν. Orelli recalls Hector's taunt to Rhesus the
Thracian (Eur. RheS. 418), οὐκ ἐν δεμνίοις πυκνὴν ἄμυστιν ὡς σὺ
δεξιούμενοι. For the Thracian habits, see on Od. 1. 18. 8.

16. vivax, breve. Merely for the pleasure of the antithesis, cp.
Od. 2. 20. 9, 11 ‘ asperae, leves.’ ‘ Breve‚’ ‘ short-lived,' as ‘brevis
