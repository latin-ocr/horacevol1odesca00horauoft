THE ODES OF HOVRACE

14. temptare, as it were ‘to lay siege to' their goodwill. Cp.

A. Ρ. 405 ‘gratia regum Pieriis temptata modis? andVirgil's ‘ animam ι

temptare precand0,' Aen. 4. 113. ‘ Deos' is constructed ἀπὸ κοινοῦ

(see on 1. 3. 6) after ‘temptare' and ‘coronantem'3 ‘parvos' is ·

properly an epithet of the images, not of the‘gods themselves, and
therefore belongs to ‘ Deos ’ as the object of ‘coronantem‚' rather
than as the object of ‘ temptare' (see on 2. 5. 13) 3 at the same time
it is antithetical to ‘multa caede‚’ so that it cannot be severed from
‘ temptare‚' but serves rather as a link between the two clauses,
as though he said ‘your very gods are small (i. e. in their repre-
sentative images) ε adapt your offerings to them.’

15. parvos, as Tibull. 1. c. ‘ exigua ligneus aede deus.' Cp. with
all this Juv. 12. 87, 88. ν

marino rore, rosemary.

16. fragili, ‘easily plucked,’ a sprig of myrtle, opposed to more
elaborate and expensive garlands; so ‘simplex myrtus' (1. 38. 5)
opposed to ‘ nexae philyra coronae!

17. immunis. The Schol. interpreted this as = ‘ immunis
scelerum,’ and some editors have followed them. It seems an
impossible meaning to put upon the word. No doubt it meant
usually ‘exempt,' as from some duty or tax3 it was used meta-
phorically with a genitive of the thing from which the exemption
was claimed, as Virg. Aen. 12. 559 ‘immunem belli,' Ov. Her. 14.
8 ‘immunes caedis! But the genitive in such cases -was essential
to the meaning. On the other hand, Horace uses the adj. in two
other passages (Od. 4. 12. 22 ‘ non ego te meis Immunem meditor
tingere poculis: and Epp. 1. 14. 33 ‘immunem Cinarae placuisse
rapaci') in the sense of ‘ without gifts,' adapting the word, after his
fashion, to the Greek ἅδωρος. The whole attempt to force this
meaning on ‘immunis,' seems to be founded on a misconception
of the stanza. The moral purity of the hand which offers the
acceptable gift may be assumed by the poet, but it is not expressed.
The doctrine is simply that the gods do not look for costly offerings
from humble worshippers. If ‘immunis’ meant ‘immunis scele-
rum,’ it would be the most weighty word in the Ode, and Horace
would not have left his readers to make up the distinctive part of
its meaning by conjecture.

18—20. There is a doubt as to the relation of v. 18 to the stanza.
It is usually taken (after Lambinus) as qualifying what follows,
‘Though your hand when laid on the altar be giftless‚ it has
sostened the displeasure of the Penates with its pious offering of
meal and crackling salt, and could please no more (‘ non blandior
[futura] ’ Lambin.)‚ {f z‘t bought a costly victim.' It has been pro-
posed lately (by Mr. Page and others) to amend this by making
‘ non sumptuosa blandior hostia ’ a negative expansion of ‘ immunis,'
‘ gifssess, not winning a hearing by means of a costly victim.' This
is tempting by its greater simplicity‚ but it may be doubted whether
it does not weaken the force of the line. If it is coordinate with
‘immunis ’ it is a less emphatic and forcible expression of the idea.
