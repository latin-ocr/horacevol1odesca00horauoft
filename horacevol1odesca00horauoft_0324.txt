THE ODES OF HORACE

6. turbidum laetatur. Meineke compares an expression of
Pherecrates, Fr. 2 γελῶντα καὶ χαίροντα και τεθολωμὲνον.

7. paro· Liber. He prays the god to moderate the violence
of the overmastering ἐνθουσιασμός, not to strike him with the
terrible thyrsuS, the blows of which inspired the Bacchic frenzy.

9. fas . . . est. Bentley was dissatisfied with the boldness of
this assertion following on the‘ trep idat’ and‘ parce, 'and wished
to read ‘sit.’ But see what has bepen said in the Introduction to
the Ode. It is the expression of joy at finding a vent for his
overwrought feelings.

pervicaces, ‘untiringl

Thyiadas (from θύειν), a name of the Bacchantes.

Cp. Eur. Bacch. 706 foll. 'Amy δὲ νάρθηκ’ ἐς πέδον καθῆκε γῆς, Ι και
τῇδε κρήνην ἐξανῆκ’ οινου θεός· Ι” οσαις δὲ λευκοῦ πώματος πόθος παρῆν, Ι
ἄκροισι δακτύλοισι διαμῶσαι χθόνα Ι γάλακτος ἑσμοὺς εἶχον· ἐκ δὲ
κισσίνων Ι θυρσων γλυκεῖαι μέλιτος ἕσταζον“ ροαί. See also ib. 142.

11. truncis cavis. The resemblance to the passage just quoted
from Eur. Bacch. makes it very probable that‘ trunci’ is used here
of the hollow thyrsus. If it is of the trunks of trees, compare the
golden age in Virg. E. 4. 30, when ‘durae quercus sudabunt roscida
mel a.

13. beatae, predicative. The song is to be of Ariadne' s apothe-
0515, as well as of the transformation of her crown into a star.

14. honorem, her ornament, her crown, the ‘Gnosia ardentis
stella coronae‚’ Virg. G. 1. 222. See the story in Ov. Met. 8. 176.
For the use of ‘honos’ cp. Virg. Aen. 7. 814 ‘regius ostro Velet
honos umeros?

tecta Penthei, Eur. Bacch. 633 δώματ’ ἔρρηξεν χαμᾶζε· συντε-
θράνωται δ’ ἅπαν.

16. Lycurgi, Hom. 11. 6. 130 foll„ Soph. Ant. 955.

17. This refers to his conquest of India. The powers of nature
aided him in the enterprise3 the Orontes and Hydaspes turned
their streams at the touch of his thyrsus that he might cross
them, and the sea grew calmnbefore him. Nonnus, Dionysiaca
13. 12 .

fleot313 can only be used of ‘mare ’ by a zeugma.

barbarum, sc. ‘Rubrum vel Indicum.’

18. separatis, as ‘remotis‚' v. 1.

E uvidlus, opposed to ‘ SiccuS,’ 4. 5. 39 ; βεβρεγμένος, μέθῃ βρεχθείς,

ur. E . 326.

20. Bistonidum. The Bistones (fem. Bistonis, plur. Bistonides)
were a tribe of Thrace, a chief home of the Dionysiae cultus.
Bacchus is represented as twisting vipers in their hair without
injury1 to himself or thern (‘ sine fraude,’ cp. Carm. S. 41). Cp. Eur.
Bacc . 101 foll.

23. Rhoetum, 3. 4. 55. Nauck thinks that Rhoetus owes his
selection to the assonance ‘ Rhoetum retorsisti.’

leonis, actually in the form of a lion. See Hom. Hymn. 6. 44,
Eur. Bacch. 1019 φάνηθι . . . πυριφλέγων ὁρᾶσθαι λέων.
