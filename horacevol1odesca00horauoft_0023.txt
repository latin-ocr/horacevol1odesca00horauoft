GENERAL IN TRODUCT ION

Ο. Keller¹, who has collected and used with much ingenuity all
f the available evidence on the subject, gives the palm of antiquity
&to the Scholia of Porphyrion. The only limit set to their date by
· external testimony is to be found in the mention of Porphyrion’ s
3name by Charisius, a grammatical writer, usually placed about
ἡ A. D. 4003 but Keller thinks they are as early as A. D. 200—2 50. The
evidence on which he relies consists wholly of indications in the
[Scholia themselves, such as (a) the writer's personal knowledge of

  
   
   
 
    
   
 
    
   
    
   
   

„Rome coupled with the fact that he never alludes to the walls of
'Aurelian (Α. D. 271), while he recognizes the older gates, as e. g. the
Porta Esquilina on Epod. 5. 100, Sat. 1. 8. 1 ; (b) his use of Parthi,
Parthicus, &c. as designations of the great eastern monarchy‚ in
’ several places where the Pseudo-Acron uses Persae, Persicus,
‘a natural variation if the fall of Parthia and the rise of the Persian
denasty of the Sassanidae (A.D. 226) had taken place between the
tho dates; (c) his way of speaking of the religious ceremonies of
:heathen Rome as though they were still observed in his own time.
'Contrast, e. g., his note on Od. 3. 11. 6 ‘fidicines hodieque Romae
¹sacrificiis adhiberi videmus ’ with Acron's ‘et in sacrificiis fidicines
‚adhiberi consueverant,' or that on Od. 2. 16. 14 ‘salinum‚ patella in
-qua primitiae dis cum sale *dantur ’ with Acron's ‘ patella in qua dis
[primitiae offerebantur,’ or lastly‚ that on 3. 5. 11 ‘Aeternam Vestam,
‚Lpropter aeternos ignis qui in ara eius coluntur’ with Acron’s
*³ aeterni ignis qui in ara eius indefesse colebatur)

'j' The genuine Acron wrote earlier than Porphyrion, if the latter‘s
-ιιιοῖειῖίοη of him on Sat. 1. 8. 25 is not an interpolation, ‘memini
,³ ue legere apud Helenium Acronem Saganam fuisse libertum Pom·
monii senatoris qui a triumviris est proscriptus.' It is to be re-
Ϊ ι arked, however, that the statement thus quoted does not occur in
Ιἱ ne Scholia which go under Acron's name. On the other hand, we
d in them the change of tense already noticed with respect to
critices, &c., which would point to their being later than the
prohibition of heathen ceremonies by Theodosius in A.D. 391 3 we
{find (unless these be interpolations) the names of the Goths (on
bod. 4. 15. 22), and according to one MS. of the Huns (on Od. 2.
Ξῖ· 11. 1), and a hint perhaps of the desolation of Italy by the bar-
barians (on Od. 3. 4. 16) 3 and we find, subJect to the same proviso,
