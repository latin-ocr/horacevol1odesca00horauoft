‘ of Hauthal (Berlin, 1864) and Pauly (Prague, 1858), and more
’ τεεεητῙΥ the edition of Porphyrion's Scholia by Holder.

I have referred also frequently to Estre's Prosopographeia

Horatiana (Amsterdarn, 1846), Franke's Fasti Horatiani (Berlin,
’ 1839), Horaz-Studien, Pliiss‚ Teubner, 1882, and Studies in the

y Odes of Horace, A. W. Verrall (Macmillan, 1884).

The English translators of Horace, especially Conington, have

{j often suggested a happy rendering or a new view.

§m- HORACE’S EARLY LIFE IN HIS WRITINGS.

Ncime—Quintus‚ Sat. 2. 6. 37.
Horatius, Od. 4. 6. 44, Epp. 1. 14. 5.
Flaccus, Sat. 2. 1. 18, Epod. 15. 12.

[Of the origin of the ‘cognomen’ nothing can be guessed. The
‘nomen' might imply that his father, on manumission, had taken
a gentile name from some member of the Horatia gens, It is now
more generally believed, on a suggestion of G. F. Grotefend, that it

:v was derived from the Horatia tribus, the one of the country tribes
j= in which the colony of Venusia was enrolled, and to which Horace’s
,ζ’ father, as a libertus of Venusia, would belong]
