Oct. 22. This was in B.c. 29. The Senate offered him a triumph
· on other occasions, as in Β. C. 25 after his campaign in Spain, but
it was refused.

50. pater. The title of ‘ Pater patriae’ was not solemnly given
to Augustus by the Senate till Β. c. 2, but, as Ovid says, Fast. 2.
127, it was only the ratification of a title which had been long given
him by popular usage: ‘ Sancte Pater patriae, tibi Plebs, tibi Curia
nomen Hoc dedit; hoc dedimus nos tibi nomen Eques 3 Res tamen
· ante dedit! It was a title familiar to Roman ears, having been
given by the Senate to Cicero (Juv. 8. 243), and in earlier times to
Camillus by the army (Liv. 5. 49); and ‘ Parenti patriae’ had been
1 the inscription placed by the people on the column erected in the
Forum to Julius Caesar's memory, Suet. Jul. 85. Horace promises
ν (Od. 3. 24. 27) a similar title to any one who will venture to restrain
the licence of the time, pointing, of course, to Augustus, ‘ Si quaeret
Pater urbium Subscribi statuis, indomitam audeat Refrenare licen-
tiam!

princeps. Od. 1. 21. 14, 4. 14. 6. According to Mommsen and
⁴ Professor Pelham (Joumal of Philology, vol. viii. p. 322 f.) this title
which Octavianus took was not a shortened form of ‘princeps
senatuS,' although he held that dignity, but of ‘ princeps in

stay the civil war, and to retrieve the military glory of Rome, which

in Β. c. 3 .

ODE III

Ι ‘ Ο ΞΗΙΡ, in which Virgil is sailing to Greece‚ carry thy precious
Γ burden safely. It is a dreadful risk, the sea. He was a hard, bold
’ man who first ventured upon it. The gods meant it to be a barrier
impassable‚ but man delights in disobedience. Prometheus brought
fire on earth and sickness with it. Daedalus tried to fly. Acheron
was no barrier to Hercules. Where shall we stop? and when will
Jove be able to lay aside his bolts of wrath ?'

This Ode has been often referred to the voyage of Virgil to
Athens, from which he returned only to die in B.C. 19. This,
however, would fix its composition four years later than the date
’ which on other grounds we assign to the publication of Books i—iii3
ι nor is it an Ode which is likely to have been inserted after publica·
