6. terrarum dominos. Ovid seems to have taken these words
as in apposition to ‘,'deos Pont. 1. 35 ‘Nam tua non alio coluit
penetralia ritu Terrarum dominos quam colis ipse deos,’ where the
play lies ln applying to the gods a familiar designation b'ut m a new
sense; ‘the gods’ being a metaphorical term for Caesar and his
family. Lucan (8. 208) uses the expression again in the sense
merely of‘ kings,' the original passage probably being hardly in his
mind. Dillenburger would take ‘terrarum dominos' here as =
‘quasi sint facti terrarum domini,’ ‘raises them to heaven, very
lords of the world,' i. e. in their own feeling and estimation (cp.
Od. 4. 2. 17 ‘ quos Elea domum reducit Palma caelestis ') ; and he

is followed by many editors, Ovid’s imitation perhaps shows that
this is wrong; but the same sense is to be elicited from the simpler

with the sentence which follows, have sometimes taken the words as
a designation of the Romans, who are contrasted with the Greeks,

· the objects of the preceding verses. Cp. the contrast of the two

be the same as Virgil’‘s Romanos rerum dominos) Aen. 1. 2823

Romans collectively, and that we still lack proof that it could have

. been tolerated if used, as it would be here, of individuals.

7-9. hunc . . . illum. We must supply ‘ iuvat ' from v. 4. The

. · interposition of the fresh verb ‘evehit ’ has been felt to be a diffi-
, culty. Bentley avoided it by altering ‘ evehit ’ to ‘evehere,’ which

Rutgers had previously suggested the course which has been
followed lately by Macleane and Munro, supported by ‘ the emphatic
advocacy of Dr. Kennedy.’ They put a full stop at ‘ nobilis,’ making
‘evehit ’ the verb of the new sentence. The serious objection to
this view lies in the break of rhythm, resulting in an anti· climax,
caused by stopping at‘ nobilis? The parallels which Munro alleges,
such as 3. 30. 5, (10 not touch the poverty of‘ palmaque nobilis' if it
is the subject of the preceding verb, the last in a series which
descends both in fullness of sense and in weight of sound.

7. mobilium. The epithet, if it reflects the poet's own feeling
(cp. Epp. 1. 19. 34 ‘ ventosae plebis,’ Od. 3. 2. 20 ‘ popularis aurae ⁹),
suits also the feeling of the poem. It is the parallel of the ‘ dust ’
of v. 3, the dangers of v. 24, the discomforts of v. 25, &c. ‘ Each

pursuit has its drawbacks, yet men follow it in spite of them.’

turba has a similar force, something of Juvenal’s ‘ turba Remi,’

‘quod enim fretum, quem Euripum, tot motuS‚ tantas, tam varias
habere putatis agitationes commutationesque fluctuum, quantas per-
turbationes et quantos aestus habet ratio comitiorum?' Plane. 4. 9
