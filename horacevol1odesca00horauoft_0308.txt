THE ODES OF HORACE

Pelopis parens. Tantalus, joined with Prometheus in the two ⁷
passages referred to, For the legend of him see Hom. Od. 11. 582.

38. laborem. The question between ‘laborem’ and ‘laborum'
isa doubtful one, and as old as the Schol., Porph. interpreting the
former, Aer. the latter. Of the MSS„ B has the acc., V had the
gen. Bentley pointed out that the mistaken constr. ‘ sono laborum '
(which is found in Aer.) very possibly suggested the reading. In
either qase it is an attempt to put the usual ‘ decipere laborem ² (Sat.
2. 2. 12 ‘studio fallente laborem') into the passive, either retaining ¹
its accusative, as in such phrases as ‘suspensi tabulam loculosque
lacerto,' or taking instead of it the Greek genitive of relation.

39. Orion. Τὸν δὲ μετ’ Ὠρίωνα πελώριον εἰσενόησα Ι θῆρας ὁμοῦ
εἰλεῦντα κατ’ ἀσφοδελὸν λειμῶνα, Hom. Od. 11. 572. Orion, like
Sappho and Alcaeus, is engaged in the same pursuits as in life. ⁴
Virg. Aen. 6. 654 ‘fuit vivis quae cura . . . eadem sequitur tellure¹
repostos!

40. Priscian, p. 689, quotes this line, remarking Horace’s use of λ ’

lyncas as masc.; Virg. G. 3. 264 makes it fem. ‘lynces Bacchi
variae.

ODE XIV

⁵ THE years are flying, Postumus; no prayers will stay them; not
three hecatombs a day will turn the heart of Pluto the tearless, the.
almighty, who holds Geryon fast, despite his three bodies, and -
Tityos, behind the Styx, aye, the Styx, which we must all cross
alike, rich and poor. You may avoid all common risks, yet you ,
must die. The treasures that you have boarded your wiser heir
will squander.'

The burden is the same as that of Od. 2. 3 and 11, and of 4. 7 ⁴ ¹

‘ Life is short, let us enjoy it while we may ' ς but there is more of
sadness in this Ode than in the others. The usual moral is hinted

in the passing epithet ‘dignior' bestowed on the heir who is to ’ ’

waste our store of choice wine ; but the feeling of the stanza is not
so much for his wisdom as for the additional bitterness which it
adds to our labours to know that they may be all undone as soo'n f
as we are dead. ‘ We must leave it ⁴unto a man that shall be aster
us, and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool?’
Eccles. 2. 19. There is no clue to the person addressed. It has

been suggested that he may be the Postumus to whom Propertius . ⁷

writes his Elegy (3. 12).

1. fugaces labuntur. We must not try to harmonize the meta-
phor, although both ‘fugax’ (Od. 2.3. 12) and ‘labi ' (Epp. 1. 2. 43) ’
are used of running water: ‘the fieeting years slide by.’ Words

are accumulated which convey the idea of rapid and continuous ’ “

motion, but the mind does not dwell on the form long enough
