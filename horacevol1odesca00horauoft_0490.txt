THE EPODES OF HORACE

6. deus, sc. ‘Amor.’

nam, gives the reason of ‘ occidis.⁸ ‘It is wearisome to be
asked, for 1 have only one answer to give.

7. olim, better probably with‘ promissum 'than with‘ inceptos!

promissum, ‘promised to the world,’ as A. P. 45‘ promissi
carminis auctor!

iambos, under this name Horace would include all his Epodes,
as in Epp. 1. 19. 23 ‘Parios ego primus iambos Ostendi Latio.’ In
Epp. 2. 2. 59 he divides his poetryinto‘ carmina? ‘’Odes ; ‘iambi‚'
Epodes; and‘ Bionei sermones, ’Satires.

8. umbilicum, properly the knob at each end of the roller, which
was fastened to the bottom of the parchment when full, and on
which it was rolled. The expression, therefore, means to prepare
for publication and to finish. Mart. 4. 89. 1 ‘ Ohe iarn satis est
ohe libelle, Iam pervenimus usque ad umbilicos.’

9-12. This may possibly mean that Anacreon also had given his
love as an excuse for not w'riting.

12. non elaboratum, of a free mette, ‘numeris lege solutis,’
Od.4.2. 11.

pedem, as in Od. 4. 6. 35 ‘Lesbium pedem.'

ἆ3. ignis. With the play on the double meaning of ‘ignis' cp.
O 2. 4. 7 note.

16. macerat, Od. 1. 13. 8.

EponE XV

‘YOU remember the night, Neaera, when you swore eterna! love
to me. It is unhappy for you that 1 am not as light-minded as
you. Your beauty will not tempt me back to you again. And for
you, sir, my successful rival, be you ever so rich and wise and
beautiful, you will be deserted as I have been, and 1 shall laugh
at you yet.’

Metre—Pytht'ambz'cum 1¹¹¹.

1. Night and the moon are named partly as ‘non infideles
arbitrae' (Epod. 5. 50) of her vows, partly to recall to her the
scene.

3. laesura, by her perjury.

4. in verba, properly to swear according to the formula dictated
by the person administering the oath.1ts common use was of the
soyldier' s oath of allegiance. Horace uses it here of a lover’s oath;
in Epp.1.1.14 of allegiance to a teacher in philosophy.

6. lentis, ‘clingingss as of the vine, Virg. E. 3. 38.

7. dum pecori lupus, the complete construction has to be sup-
plied from the following clause, whether we take it to be‘ infestus
sit’ or, more fully, ‘infestus turbaret ovilia.'

Orion, Od. 1. 28. 21, 3.27. 18, Epod. 10. 20.
