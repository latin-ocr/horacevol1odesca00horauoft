,y to preach. In his Odes he would have his readers take him as the
poet of mirth and love (‘ non praeter solitum levis,') never to be
2 taken too seriously, surprised sometimes into lofty themes and
ρ, genuine enthusiasm‚ but recovering himself before he has done

injury to subjects for which he is unfit.

This irony expresses itself within the Odes in many ways-in the

ξ negative form of such Odes as 1. 6, 2. 12, 4. 2, in the apologetic

stanza which concludes 2. 1 or 3. 3, in the half humorous way in

’ which he recalls his share in the campaign of Philippi in 2. 7. But

we miss a great deal of its effect if we do not notice it also in their
arrangement. It is this rather than the mere desire for variety
which dictates the distribution of the political Odes at long inter-
vals. They must not seem to claim too large a share in the writer’s
thoughts. It rules also to some extent the particular sequence in
which they are placed. The most evident instance is the elaborate
prelude to B. iv; but there is something of the same spirit in the
arrangement which makes 1. 2, the political recantation and pro-

ζ fession which he sets in the forefront of the poems, follow 1. 1, in
which he has apologized for the poet’s art as one of the thousand
ῑι unaccountable tastes of mankind ; or again in the position of 1. 12,

between the astrologers of Leuconoe and the coquetries of Lydia.
The same effect is sought again in the light touch of ‘ Persicos odi ’
and ‘ Quid fles Asterie,’ which follow and relieve the earnestness of
1. 37 and 3. 1-6.

ᾗ 13. That a certain veil of irony is thrown over them increases
rather than diminishes our sense of the important place which the
political Odes held in the disposition of the three Books. It may
even be suggested that the triple division is due to them. Not only

- do they occupy prominent places in each book3 they are so
: disposed as to give the sense, as between the three Books, of
, a progress and development in the poet's political ideas. In B.i

(2, 12, 14, 35, 37) the rule of Octavianus is accepted as the welcome
end⁴ of the civil wars, and as the deliverance (and this is empha-
sized by the place given to 37) from the alternative rule of Antony
and Cleopatra with its degrading accompaniments. The tone and
arguments are still to a great extent those of the Epodes. , ln
Β.ἰί we have less of politics; but Ode 1 repeats in the form of
