THE EPODES OF HORACE

banquet which is to match the occasion,—partly in the news of

this crowning victory of his friend and his policy.

5. tibiis, lyra. The two instruments are used even at Homer's

banquets3 Il. 18. 495 αὐλοὶ φόρμιγγές τε βοὴν ἕχον. Cp. Od. 3. 19.
16—18. There is a doubt, however, whether ‘mixtum’ must be
pressed to mean that they were used at the same moment, as the
next verse would then imply not merely that the two instruments j¹
but the two ‘ modes ' or ‘ scales,' ἡ Δωριστί and ἡ Φρυγιστί, could be ”

played together (see Dict. Ant. end of Article on Greek Music). ὲ

For the plural ⁴ tibiis’ see on Od. 1. 1. 32.

6. illis, sc. ‘sonantibuS,' as though the construction had been

‘ sonantibus mixtum carmen tibiis et lyra.'

barbarum, used instead of ‘Phrygium' for the sake of the
antithesis to ‘ Dorium! The Phrygian mode and its. appropriate ’

instrument belong rather to orgies and revelry (Od. 3. 19. 16), the
Dorian to martial music. This occasion calls for both.

7. nuper. Five years before, when Sextus Pompeius (in Sept.
Β. C. 36) was totally defeated by Agrippa off Naulochus in Sicily,
and driven from the sea to take refuge in Asia.

Neptunius3 he called himself the son of Neptune and the sea,
Appian 5. 100, Dion 48. 19. In the same chapter Dion speaks of
the multitude of runaway slaves who joined his fleet, cp. Epod. 4. 19.

10. servis, ἀπὸ κοινοῦ with ‘detraxerat’ and ‘amicus,’ see on
Od. 1. 3. 6.

11. posteri negabitis, cp. Od. 2. 19. 2 ‘credite posteri‚' of some-
thing strange.

12. emancipatum? sold as a slave! Cic. Phil. 2. 21. 51 ‘ venditum

atque emancipatum tribunatum,' and with dative de Sen. 11. 38 Α,
‘emancipata nemini.' Cp. Plaut. Bacch. 1. 1. 59 ‘Nunc mulier
tibi me emancipo3 tuus sum, tibi operam d0.’ ‘Emancipare' by 1
itself is ‘to free from ‘⁴ mancipium,” ' with a dat. it came to mean ’·

‘ to transfer from one “ mancipium ’' to another,' ‘ to sell.' N otice
that the word takes up and parallels ‘servis ’ of v. 10. This time
it is not only a case of employing slaves. Romans are slaves.

13. fert vallum et arma, i. e. is a Roman soldier still in disci-
pline and endurance. Compare Cicero's account of what a soldier
carried on his march, Tusc. 2. 16. 37 ‘qui labor et quantus
agminis, ferre plus dimidiati mensis cibaria, ferre si quid ad usum
velint, ferre vallum! Nam scutum, galeam, gladium, in onere
nostri milites non plus numerant quam humeros, lacertos, manus;
arma enim membra militis esse dicunt.’ ‘Vallus' is a stake for
palisading.

et spadonibus, see on Od. 1. 37. 9. ‘Et' from the context

acquires the force of ‘et tamen.'

14. potest, in the sense of τλῆναι, see on Od. 3. 11. 31.

16. sol aspicit, a trope common to all nations‚ ‘ before all Israel
and before the sun.2

conopium, a gauze curtain or tent to keep off mosquitoes. The
Romans despised it as a sign of effeminacy; see Paley on Prop. 3.
