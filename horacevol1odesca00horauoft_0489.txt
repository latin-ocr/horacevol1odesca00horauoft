EPODE XI, 20—EPODE XIV, 5

6.l'1'orquato, see on Od. 3. 21. 1 ‘ O nata mecum consule
Man i0.'

7. cetera mitte loqui, Od. 1. 9. 9 ‘ Permitte divis cetera.’

benigna viee, Od. 1. 4. 1 ‘ grata vice!

8. Achaemenio, Od. 3. 1. 44.

9. Cyllenea, i. e. Mercury's, see on Od. 3. 4. 4.

8 12. invicte, to be taken by itself, as in Virg. Aen. 6. 365 and
. 293.

13. manet, ‘ you are fated to go there)

Assaraci, the grandfather of Anchises, Virg. Aen. 1. 284.

frigida, Hom. ΙΙ. 22. 151, of one of the fountains of Scamander
(the other was hot), ἡ δ’ ἑτέρη θέρεϊ προρέει ἐϊκυῖα χαλάζῃ, Ι ἢ χιόνι

v -

ψ ἔὲἷνὶ, not the Homeric view, Il. 20. 73 μέγας ποταμὸς βαθυδίνης, Ι
ὃν Ξάνθον καλέουσι θεοί, ἄνδρες δέ Σκάμανδρον. But the Romans
noticed the smallness of the streams of Troy, Luc. 9. 974 ‘ [Caesar]
Inscius in sicco serpentem pulvere rivum Transierat qui Xanthus
erat.’ So far as it has any rhetorical purpose, and the epithets
are sprinkled with a freedom which Horace's later style would
have repudiated, it seems to carry a faint verbal antithesis to
‘ grande,' and to emphasize the ‘smallness’ of the lot, of which,
nevertheless‚ Chiron bids him make the best.

14. lubricus, ‘ sliding,’ Ov. Fast. 6. 238 ‘lubrice Tibri!

15. certo, as ‘post certas hiemes,’ Od. 1. 15. 35 3 the length of

036. mater caerula, Thetis, the sea-nymph, as ‘Circe vitrea‚'

. 1. 17. 20.

18. alloquiis, seems to be used like the Greek παραμυθία, παρη-
γορίαι, with a genitive case, ‘the sweet solaces of grim sadness.'
Bentley would insert ‘ ac ’ before ‘ dulcibus’ and construet ‘aegri-
moniae’ after ‘ malum.’

EPODE XIV

‘YOU are always asking me why I am so forgetsul of my promise
to finish my Epodes. It is love that hinders me. I am not the
first poet who has been the slave of love. You know the pain
yourself. But you are a happy man compared with me.’

Metre —Pythz’ambz‘cum Im.

4. arente fauce, and therefore greedily, a large draught.

5. candide, Epp. 1. 4. 1 ‘Albi‚ nostrorum sermonum candide
iudex‚' ‘frank,' ‘honest.' Horace implies that he will be equally
‘frank’ in his answer to the question; so the repetition ⁶ deus·
deus ’ corresponds to ‘ saepe rogando?
