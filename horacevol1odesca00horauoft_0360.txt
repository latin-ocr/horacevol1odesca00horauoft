THE ODES OF HORACE

utriusque linguae, an habitual phrase for Greek and Latin,
barbarous tongues being ignored. ‘ Ut par sis in utriusque orationis
facultate‚’ Cic. de Off. 1. 1. 1. Cp. Hor. Sat. 1. 10. 23. Horace
addresses Maecenas as ‘docte ’ in Epp. 1. 19. 1.

6. voveram. The plpft.‚ because he is explaining the antecedent
ground (ἐξ a past action, viz. of this preparation of the altar,
flowers, c.

duleis epulae, ‘ a dainty feast'; cakes were offered as well as
the victim. Mart. 9. 91. 15 foll. ‘ Sic Martis tibi serviant Kalendae
Et cum ture meroque victimaque Libetur tibi candidas ad aras
Secta plurima quadra de placenta.’

7. Libero, see on Od. 2. 17. 28. Bacchus would interfere to
preserve him as one of the gods of poetry.

caprum, a goat, as the fitting offering to Bacchus. Virg. G. 2.
380 ; ‘ white,’ because he is one of the ‘ Di superi ’; black victims
were offered to the ‘ inferi.’

funeratu5‚ ‘brought to my grave.’ The word in this meta·
phorical sense is not found elsewhere.

9. hie dies, &c.‚ ‘this day a holiday in each returning year!

10. In order to ripen the wine sooner, it was customary to
construet the ‘apotheca’ in such a pl ,ce as to be exposed to the
smoke and hot air of the bath furiuces. This rendered it more
necessary carefully to protect the cork (as here with a coating of
pitch)‚ lest the flavour of the smoke should penetrate to the wine.
See Dict. Ant. s. v. ‘ vinum!

d 'uli‘bibem institutae, ‘ which was taught the lesson of
rm m .'

12. cgneme Tullo, probably L. Volcatius Tullus, who was consul
in B.c. 66, the year before Horace’s birth. Cp. 3. 21. 1 ‘O nata
mecum Consule Manlio.’ This was not an extreme age (cp. 3. 14.
13 ‘Cadum Marsi memorem duelli‚’ i.e. as old as B.c. 88), and
the occasion demands the oldest wine in the cellar. Another
L. Volcatius Tullus was consul with Augustus in B.C. 33.

13. amici, the genitive of vthe person in whose honour the cup
is drunk. Cp. 3. 19. 9 foll. ‘Da lunae propere novae, Da noctis
mediae, da, puer, auguris Murenae! The custom and the con-
struction are Greek. Theoc. 14. 18 ἔδοξ’ ἐπιχεῖσθαι ἄκρατον Ι &ravos
ἤθελ’ ἕκαστος, ἔδει μόνον ὦτινος εἷπῆν. Orelli quotes also Antiph. in
Athen. 10. 21 κυάθους θεῶν τε καὶ θεαινῶν μυρίους. This illustrates
also ‘ centum’ for an indefinite number. Madeane, referring to the
custom mentioned in Ov. F ast. 3. 531 foll. (⁴ Sole tamen vinoque
calent, annosque precantur Quot sumant calices, ad numerumque
bibunt. Invenies illic qui Nestoris ebibat annos, Quae sit per
calices facta Sibylla suos ')‚ thinks it is equivalent to saying, ‘ wish
me a hundred years of 1ife.’

14· vigiles, to keep the banquet up all night ; 1. 27. 5, 3. 21. 23
‘vivae lucernae'; Virg. Aen. 9. 338 ‘Aequasset nocti ludum in
lucemque tulisset! Orelli contrasts the expression of Ov. Her. 19.
195 ‘iam dormitante lucerna.’
