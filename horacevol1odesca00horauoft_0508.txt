ξ 2. The Alcaic stanza is found in 37 011651-

ἶ 1- 9,16, 17, 26, 27, 29, 31, 34, 35, 37-
0 2· 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,14,15,17,19,2ο.
3 3· 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 17, 21, 23, 26, 29-

§.a 4· 4, 9, 14, 15·

It employs three kinds oflverses:—- V ,
⁶¹· ⁵²·-vs-- l-vvs-ss‘·
Β κ-α-υ---υ-ξι
γ’ -υυὲ-υυ-υ-ὲέ

a being repeated twice.

lt is obvious that we have here variations of two movements;
xerse β repeats and amplifies the movement of the first half of a,
verse γ repeats the dactylic movement of the second half, putting
the t1ochees after instead of before it. This consideration proves
that although to the ear the movement of β and of the first half of a
is iambic, it was in idea a sequence of trochees preceded by an
unemphatic syllable or ‘anacrusis’ The anacrusis is as often short
as long in the fragments of Alcaeus and Sappho. In Horace it is
occasionally short, but more rarely in β than in a, and never in
either in Book iv.

Alcaeus had admitted a spondee in the place of the second
trochee. Horace made the spondee imperative, see on Od. 3. 5. 17,
3.·23. 18.

The division of the two halves of the line 15 marked by a caesura,
which is only violated twice, in Od. 1. 37. 14 ‘Mentemque lym-
phatam Mareotico? and 4.14. 17 ‘Spectandus m certamine Martio!
There are two other instances where a preposition at the beginning
of a composite word gives a quasi-caesura, 1. 16. 21 ‘Hostile ara-

trum exercitus insolens,’ 1. 37. 5 ‘Antehac nefas depromere .

Caecubum.' Horace seems to have paid great attention to the
rhythm of verse β, excluding‚ and more carefully in his later
poems, all conjunctions of words which did not by their accent
counteract that natural sameness of movement which we find
undisguised in Alcaeus, λαῖφος δὲ πᾶν ζάδηλον ἤδη, &c. No quadri·
syllabic ending or beginning is found in Book iv except of the
forms of ‘Nomen beati qui Deorum' and ‘Consulque non unius
anni.’ Verses of the form of ‘Gaudes‚ apricos necte flores’ (1. 26. 7)
are found only in 1. 16, 26, 29, 35, and 2. 1, 3, 13, 14, 19. ‘Hunc
Lesbio sacrare plectro’ in 1. 26. 11 is unique. 1t was the occurrence
of these two verses in 1. 26, and of the verse ‘ Alcaee, plectro dura
navis' in 2. 13, that called Lachmann’ s attention to the wrong date
assigned by F ranke on Justinus' authority, to the quarrel of
Phraates and Tiridates, and consequently to these Odes, which
thus became specimens of Horace’s later instead of his earlier
handiwork, see Introd. to Booksi— —iii, ξ 8.
