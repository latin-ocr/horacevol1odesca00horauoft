BOOK 111, ODE x1V, 6—ODE XV, 16

28. Planco. L. Munatius Plancus was consul in B.c. 42, the
year of Philippi. The date has doubtless a meaning, as the date of
the wine had. The times have quieted down, and Horace has
tamed down also since then. Dr. Verrall well points out, as in-
structive for other cases, how clearly the picture of N eaera’s
invitation is a picture and nothing more. The stress is on the last
stanza, not on the last but one.

ODE XV

THE subject is the same as that of 413, the odiousness and
ridiculousness of the desires and ways of youth kept on when youth
itself has departed. The spirit is rather that of the E podes (‘ Archi-
lochio felle‚' Mitsch.) than of the Odes3 it is, of course, possible
that a real person is pointed at. Meineke suggested that the name
‘Nothus,' a name unknown to extant Greek literature, was the
poetical representative of the common Latin ⁴ Spurius,’ see Introd.
to 2. 4.

Chloris is warned that she is at once old and poor'. ‘ It is time
to give up her wanton ways. What suits her daughter Pholoe does
not suit her. She is the wife of a poor man. Let hel take her
wool and sp in. That will be more becoming to her than the harp
and the wine· cup!

3. famosis laboribus, ‘scandalous occupations! They are
compared with ‘lanificiumss

4. maturo, which would not be untimely.

5. To spoil the look of their company as a cloud does a starry sky.

9. expugnat domos. The editors quote Sen. Nat. Q. 4, praef.
‘Crispus Passienus saepe dicebat, adulationi nos opponere, non
claudere ostium, et quidem sic quemadmodum opponi amicae solet,
quae, si impulit, grata est, gratior, si effregit!

14 Luceriam, an important town in the interior of Apulia. It
is called ‘nobilem,’ as famous forits wool, Plin. H. N. 8. 48. She
is to think now only of getting the best wool. The editors cpmpare
an anonymous epigram, Brunck, An. 3, p. 116‘ H τὸ πρὶν αὒχὴσασα
πολυχρυσοις ἐπ’ ἐρασταῖς, 1‘ η Νέμεσιν δεινὴν οὐχὶ κὺσασα θεάν, Ι μίσθια
ν’ῗν omoiou- πενιχροῖς πηνίσματα κρούει Ι ὀψέ γ’ Ἀθηναίη Κύπριν
ε ηισατο.

16. vetulam. The larger number of the MSS. are in favour of

‘’·vetula ‚ the Comm. Cruq. and one half of Porph.’s scholium in
favour of ‘vetulam,' ‘ non decet aetatem tuam in convivio multum
potare? Vetula would be easily altered by omitting the mark of
the m, and the distance of ‘te’ would tempt a copyist to assimilate
the adjective to the nearer substantive ‘faece’
