15. iuvenum nobilium oliens; see Introd.

17. nardi parvus onyx. ‘ Onyx' is properly a kind of marble
or alabaster, so named from its resemblance in colour to the human
nail; then a cup or box, first, of this material ; lastly, it would seem,
of any material. See Prop. 3. 10. 22 ‘murreus onyx’3 ‘unguenta
optime servantur in alabastris,‘ Plin. N. H. 13. 3 ; cp. the ἀλάβαστρον
μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς of St. Mark xiv. 3. Dillf„ who explains
‘ studium lucri ’ in v. 25, of the bargain between the wine and the
nard, quotes the story in the Gospels‚ as showing the costliness of
the nard (‘ 300 denarii’= between ,69 and ,g 10), for which he also
refers to Pliny 12. 26, 13. 2, 16. 59.

18. Sulpiciis horreis. ‘Horrea’ were ‘store-houses’ of any
kind3 see on 3. 28. 7. Here the reference is either to vaults where
wine was to be bought, or, less likely, to the store-houses in which,
in later times, we hear of persons keeping their property of various
kinds {or which they had not room at home. The name ‘Sulpiciis ’
would refer to the original erector of the buildings, or possibly, to
the possessor, the produce of whose farm and vineyard was disposed
ofin this way. Orelli quotes an inscription which makes mention
of some ‘ horrea Galbana.‚' which would very probably be the same
as the ‘ Sulpicia,’ since ‘ Galba ’ was a cognomen of the gens
Sulpicia ; and Porph. asserts that the name ‘ Galbae horrea '
belonged in his time to a certain store of wine and oil, διε. The
form ‘ Sulpiciis ’ is regular: cp. ‘ Corneliae, Iuliae, leges '; ‘ Licinia
atria,’ Cic. pro Quinct. 3. 12.

19. donare largum Append. 2, § 2.

amara curarum, as ‘ vanis rerum,’ Sat. 2. 2. 25, ‘ abdita rerum,’

21. gaudia3 4. 11. 13.

22. meree, i. e. the nard.

23. immunem = ἀσύμβολονς in Ter. Phorm. 2. 2. 25 ‘Ten' asym-
bolum venire !’ ‘without bringing your share!

24. plena, as 2. 12. 24 ‘Plenas Arabum domos.’

25. verum seems to draw attention to the last and most urgent
re uest.

(gtudium lueri3 see Introd.

26. nigrorum, of the fires of the funeral pile, as Virg. Aen. 1 1. 186
‘ignes atri.’

28. in loeo, ἐν καιρῷ, the fitting time; Epp. 1. 7. 57 ‘properare
loco et cessare?
