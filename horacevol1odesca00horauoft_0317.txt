103, Virg. G. 2. 40.

5. partem animae, Od. 1. 3. 8 ‘ animae dimidium meae!

7. neo carus aeque, sc. ‘mihi ipsi,' as Epp. 1. 3. 29 ‘ Si patriae
volumus, si nobis vivere cari.' ‘ I shall not love myself as well as before:
it will not be my whole self that will be alive.' Cp. Epod. 1. 5. 6.

8. utramque ducet ruinam, i. e. will cause both to fall at once.

supremum iter, τὰν νεάταν ὁδόν, Soph. Ant. 8073 ‘ via leti,’ Od.
1. 28. 16.

13. Chimaerae, ‘triformi Chimaera,’ Od. 1. 27. 243 Hom.
11. 6. 179 fon. Cp. the shadowy forms which Virgil places
in Aeneas’ way at the entrance of Hades, ‘variarum monstra
ferarum . . . Et centumgeminus Briareus . . . flammisque armata
Chimaera,' Aen. 6. 285.

14. si resurgat, ‘ if he were free to rise,' for he lies, according
to Horace (Od. 3. 4. 69), buried in Tartarus.

Gyas. The MSS. in 3. 4. 69 read ‘ gIgas’3 in this place they
are divided between ‘gigas ' and ‘ gygas,’ Cruquius’ MSS. all
having the latter. ‘ Gigas ' was read by Porph., Aer. (who inter—
prets it by ‘ Briareus de quo Virgilius Aen. 10. 564’)‚ and Priscian
(17. 152). In Ovid, however, the name of the hundred-handed
giant occurs in three places where the metre excludes the proper

³ case of ‘gigas,' Trist. 4. 7, Amor. 2. 1. 12, Fast. 4. 593. In the

first of these passages the MSS. vary between ‘Gygen,' ‘Gyam‚'
and ‘ Gian.' ln Hesiod, Theog. 149, 714, 734, where three brothers
are named Κόττος τε Βριάρεώς τε Γύγης· θ’ ὑπερήφανα τέκνα, the MSS.
vary between Γύγης and Γύης. Apollodorus, the mythologist, gives
the name as Γύης. Against the form Γύγης must be counted the
fact that both in Greek (see ArchilochuS, Fr. 21 οὕ μοι τὰ Γύγεω τοῦ
πολυχρύσου μέλει) and in Latin (Hor. Od. 2. 5. 20, 3. 7. 5) the first
syllable is lengthened. On this evidence Keller writes here, and in
od. 3. 4. 69, ‘ Gyas? In itself a proper name is more likely than
the general ‘ gigas?

15, 16. ‘ Hoc et iustum est et decretum a Parcis,’ Ritter. Δίκη
is sister to the Μοῖραι in Hes. Theog. 902. For the position of
‘que’ see on Od. 1. 30. 6.
