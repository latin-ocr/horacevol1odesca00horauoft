INDEX OF METRES

lay under some suspicion, on account of the historica] difficulty of
v. 17 ¹. On these facts Meineke laid down the general law that all

the Odes conformed to the type of the Alcaic, Sapphic, and third, ’

fourth, and fifth Asclepiad metres, and were to be broken into four-
line stanzas. Od. 4. 8 was to be rectified by the necessary amount
of excision, or by the supposition of some lines having fallen out.
It will be seen, on examination, that the difficulties of 4. 8. 17 have
been exaggerated ; and, at any rate, in the absence of any indica-
tion of such a quaternary division, either in the pauses of the Odes
themselves, or in the grammatical and metrical writers (who are
usually keen·eyed for ‘ laws ' in the greater poets), the chief recent
editors have not thought it necessary to alter the Ode in obedience
to the canon. Steiner pointed out that, whatever may have been
the case with the Odes which are composed in couplets, there are
but five other Odes besides 4. 8 (omitting, again, 3. 12) which are
μονόστιχα, or of uniform metre, and that this is too small an area
sor such an important induction.

¹ Bentley had complained of the same line, on account of the metrical
irregulan‘ty of the caesura, see above, § 1.
