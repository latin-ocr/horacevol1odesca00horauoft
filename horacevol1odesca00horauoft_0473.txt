insufficient, the boy is to be buried up to his chin, and left to starve,
that his marrow and liver may be ingredients in a more potent
philtre. 41—46, Folia plays her part in the incantation. What it
was, is left to our imagination3 we are only told of her power—she
could draw the moon and stars from the sky. 47-60‚ Canidia, half
afraid already that her spells are not successful, appeals to the
powers that witness her black arts, that her beloved (an old fop, on
whom she is made to pour contempt in her very prayer) may come
to her. 61-82, ‘ He comes not ; what has happened? No herb has
been omitted, nothing that could make him forget other charms.
Aha! she sees it all. He is under the spell of some more skilful
witch. He shall not get off, however. She has a stronger charm
yet to try, and heaven and earth shall change places before she lets
his love go.’ 8 5-102, The boy understands her, and interrupts the
scene with a burst of despair, in which he threatens his torturers
with the vengeance of spirits and men.

The scene is laid in the interior of a house in Rome, apparently
in the Subura; see on vv. 25, 30, 58. A misunderstanding of v. 43,
led Porph. to lay the scene at Naples.

1. at, a common particle in exclamations. It implies of course
a previous train of thought of which the speaker is conscious in
himself, or which he imagines in another. The exclamation intro-
duced by it is of the nature of an answer or of an appeal (‘ pro-
vocatio ad deos ’ ; cp. Virg. Aen. 2. 535 ‘At tibi pro scelere,
exclamat, pro talibus ausis Di,’ &c., and cp. the use of ἀλλά, e. g. in
Aesch. Cho. 306). With the reading in the text (a minority of the
MSS. has ‘regis ⁹), the actual address is not to the gods, but to the
witches, the first two lines being an exclamation. ‘ At ' introducing
the adjuration, marks the change that has come over him. He can
bear it no longer; he must know what they mean.

deorum quidquid3 Sat. 1. 6. 1 ‘ Lydorum quidquid.’

4. unum contrasts with omnium, ‘ so many against one.' With
the construction ‘vultus in me’ cp. Od. 1. 2. 39 ‘acer Mauri . . .
cruentum Vultus in hostem.’

5. te, singles out Canidia as the principal.

6. veris; cp. Epod. 17. 50. The words are doubtless meant in
the boy's mouth to have an innocent meaning, ‘if you really know
what it is to be a mother.'

7. purpurae, the ‘toga praetexta.' The edd. quote words from
one of the declamations attributed to Quintilian (340 extr.) ⁴ sacrum
illud praetextatum quo sacerdotes velantur, quo magistratus, quo
infirmitatem puerorum sacram facimus ac venerabilem.' It and
the ‘ bulla,' a thin plate of gold hung round the neck (Pers. Sat. 5.
30, 31), are the ‘ insignia’ which in v. 12 are snatched from him.

11. ut constitit, when, notwithstanding this appeal, he was
stripped and set in the midst to await their further pleasure.

15. viperis, ‘ furiali habitu,' Schol. Canidia and her fellow witches
are called Furies in Sat. 1. 8. 45.
