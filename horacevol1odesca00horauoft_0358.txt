THE ODES OF HORACE

tive, ‘ And yet. ' ‘ He is sleepless and tearful sor love of you, and
yet he has strong temptations to inconstancy.’ He 15 preparing for
the moral, ‘ whatever are your temptations, mind you are as constant
as he.'

sollicitae, as ‘‚cura 'of the restless preoccupation of love.

hospitae, at whose house he 15 lodging.

10. tuis ignibus,‘ a pas sion for one who is yours,’ ‘a passion
which only you have a right to feel)

12. temptat, as ‘temptare precando,’ Virg. Aen. 4. 113, 293, the
idea of laying siege to a city, trying every approach· , probably also
a reference to the special meaning of πειρᾶν cp. ‘temptator Dianae,’
1. 4. 71.

13. mulier perfida. Antea, according to Homer; Sthenoboea,
according to others. The story of Bellerophon' 5 refusal of Antea’ s
advances and of her unsuccessful scheme for his destruction 15 told
by Glaucus, his grandson, in Il. 6.155 foll.

perfida credulum. She was treacherous and he was easy.
Horace delights m such antithetical placing of adjectives‚ see on 1.
3. 10, and comp. 3. 5. 33 ‘perfidis credidit.’

14. impulerit, with infin. see on 1. 1. 8.

16. maturare necem, to hasten a man' 5 death, i. e. to kill him
before his time, · see Cic. pro Clu. 61.

18. Magnessam, from Iolcus, a city of the Magnetes m Thessaly,

‘ad differentiam alterius Hippolytes, Amazonum reginae, uxoris
Thesei,' Schol.

Hippolyten, Pind. Nem. 4. 56 1011.,5. 25 f011.; according to
others her name was Astydameia. Peleus was accused by her
to Acastus of assailing her honour, τὸ δ’ ἐναντίον ἔσκεν. Acastus left
him alone on Mount Pelion, having first taken away his sword,
hoping that the Centaurs might find him and slay him· , but he

was saved by Chiron, and Zeus Xenius rewarded his virtue with
the hand of Thetis.

20. historiae, μύθους, as Prop. 2. 1. 16, 5. 1. 119.

monet, ‘ calls to his mind ’ ; ‘ movet’ and ‘ monet ’ are so nearly
alike that the preponderance of MS. authority in favour of the
latter can hardly be conclusive. There is the same doubt in the
text of Ov. A. A. 3. 651 ‘ Quid iuvat ambages praeceptaque parva
monere? which would be the nearest parallel for this use of
‘moneress There are more abundant illustrations of ‘movere,’
‘fatorum arcana,' Virg. Aen. 1. 262,‘ cantus,’ ib. 7. 641.

21. frusta-em for the emphatic position cp. 3. 13. 6‘ Frustra.
nam gelidos,’ &c.

scopulis sur-dior, a common- place of the poets. Cp. Epod. 17.
53 ‘Non saxa nudis surdiora navitis’ ;.Eur Med. 28‹ ὡς δέ πέτρος

‘sur ior audit.

Icari, either‘ of the island Icarus‚’ the island round which the
Icarian sea breaks, or less likely ‘of Icarus,’ sc. the son of Daedalus,
as if the sea might be called ‘ mare Icari ' as well as ‘ mare 1carium‚’
