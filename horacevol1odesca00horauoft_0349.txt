ODE V

‘JOVE’S thunder proves him the sovereign of the sky. 'Augustus
shall prove himself a god upon earth by adding to the empire Britain
and the hateful Parthians— O shame to think of the disgrace not
yet wiped awayl—Rom'an soldiers living as captives, forgetful of
name and country, and country’ 5 gods. This was the danger that
Regulus foresaw if prisoners were allowed to hope for ransom—
“ Let them die,’' he said, “and pity them not. I have seen with
· my own eyes the sight of shame: Roman standards nailed up in
Punic temples with armour that was taken not from the dead but
from the living :—Roman citizens with their hands bound behind
their backs—Carthage peacesul and busy :—the work of our war
undone. Will you buy those soldiers back again? It will be
a waste of money. The deer caught in the net does not fight again
if you loose it, nor does the man who has once feared death make
a soldier again. He does not know what war means. ’² He put
aside his wife and children, and hung his head as one disgraced,
till the senate listened to his advice; then he went back to torture
and death with as light a heart as if he were going for a holiday’

Another phase of Augustus’ rule. He is to retrieve the deeply-
selt disgrace of Carrhae, and to restore the healthy military spirit of
ancient Rome. We have in the story of Regulus at once a measure
of the dis grace to be retrieved,— ‘ It is the very disgrace which he
feared and grforetold and went back to the torture in order to prevent‚'
——and a picture of the true Roman spirit which is to be reawakened.

The whole sentiment of the speech may be compared with Liv.
22. 59-61.

The story of Regulus’ mission to Rome is not found in Polybius,
a fact which has been held to throw doubt on its truth. It is sum-
marized in the Epitome of Liv. 18. With Cicero it is a common-
place. It is told at length in the De Off. 3. 27, a passage of which
Horace recalls several turns of thought and expression. ‘ M.Atilius

Hamilcare, iuratus missus est ad senatum ut nisi redditi essent
Poenis captivi nobiles quidam rediret ipse Karthaginem. Is curn
Romam venisset utilitatis speciem videbat ; sed eam, ut res declarat,
falsam iudicavit: quae erat talis3 manere in patria, esse domi suae
cum uxore, cum liberis; quam calamitatem accepisset in bello,
communem fortunae bellicae iudicantem, tenere consularis dignitatis
gradum. Quis negat haec esse utilia? Quem censes? Magnitudo
animi et fortitudo negat. Num locupletiores quaeris auctores?
Harum enim est virtutum proprium nihil extimescere, omnia
humana despicere, nihil quod homini accidere possit intolerandum
putare. Itaque quid fecit? In senatum venit; mandata exposuit,
