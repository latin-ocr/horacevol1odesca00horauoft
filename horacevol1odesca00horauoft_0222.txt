THE ODES OF HORACE

59. parum castis. Lightning striking a place was held to prove
that it had been polluted by some crime, and the spot was covered
lest any should tread on it. Dict. Ant. s. ν. ’11111611131ξ and 'cp.
Hor. A. Ρ. 471; 50 that Horace, with a more general meaning, j
selects a particular instance, popularly recognized, of the moral Ξ
government of Jove, ‘Caelo tonantem credidimus Iovem Regnare!

Telephus Love as passionate and boisterous as 1115 15 not the love ⁷
that lasts Happy they that are bound 1n that true chain. '¹ ’

1. Telephi. ‚Telephi‚ ‘of Telephus—always Telephus? The ’
repetition is emphatic; cp. Epod. 14. 6, and one interpretation of-
Virg. E. 7. 70 ‘Ex illo Corydon, Corydon est tempore 11011153 The
name of Telephus recurs in 3.19.26 and 4. 11. 21, and always ξ
of the same ideal character, a youth,‘ puro similis vespero, 'whose
beauty brings the ladies to his feet.

2. roseam. Virg. Aen. 1. 402 gives Venus a ‘rosea cervix.’ It ,
5661115 to describe the pink blush of life and health. ⁴

cerea. Servius, on Virg. E. 2. 53, explains this epithet as -52
meaning ‘ soft,’ ‘supple.' Flavius Caper, a grammarian older than ἴ
Servius, quotes the passage as running ‘lactea . . . bracchia,’ and
interprets it ‘candida,' which may mean either that he had found
‘lactea ’ (possibly as a gloss on ‘ cerea ’) or that he had interpreted ³
‘cerea,’ ‘white‚’ and then forgotten the exact word which Horace 3
had used instead of the simple ‘ candida.' g

4. djffieffl, χαλεπῷ. The ancients believed the liver to be the ”
seat of passion, attributing anger and even madness to fullness
of bile. ‘ Difficilis ’ is used properly of a man who is ill-tempered,
as A. P. 173 ‘ difficilis, querulus ’: the epithet is transferred to the ·
bile which is supposed to make him so. ”

5. nee mens nee eolor. Almost a zeugma, like Virgil's ‘ incep- ἡ
toque et sedibus haeret in isdem,’ Aen. 2. 654, the use of the same
verb of a mental and a physical fact, ‘my mind reels and my
colour comes and goes? ⁷

6. manent. The MS. evidence is overwhelmingly 111 favour of
‘'manent as against the‘ manet' of Β. Metrically‘ manet’ may
be easily defended. see on Od. 1. 3. 36. But the authority of Β s-
(a MS. which has suffered a good deal of interpolation) is not
sufficient to justify us in setting aside‘ manent!

8. quam: best taken, as Kiessling‚ with‘ penitus? ‘how deep go
the slow fires that consume me!

14. perpetuum, ‘constant.’
