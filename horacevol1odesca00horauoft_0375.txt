Diogenianus) to have received an oracle from the Pythia,’ αργυρέαις
λόγχηισι μάχου καὶ πάντα κρατήσεις. So Juvenal, 12. 47, calls him

‘callidus emptor Olynthi,' and Val. Max. 7. 2. 10 ‘ Mercator Grae-
ciae! In ‘ diffidit’ and ‘subruit’ (‘ undermined ⁹) we have a
continuance of the metaphors of the last stanza.

aemulos reges, such as his rivals for the throne, Pausanias
and Argaeus; the Thracian Cersobleptes‚ &c.

15. navium duces. Horace is generally supposed to be taking
an instance from contemporary history, and to aim at Menas or
Menodorus, the freedman of Sextus Pompeius and chief captain
of his ficet, who twice deserted him to serve under Octavianus, and
once deserted Octavianus to return to him. See Introd. to Epod. 4,
which has been taken by some to refer to him.

16. saevos illaqueant, an intended antithesis. ‘ Illaqueare’ is
found nowhere else till Prudentius (A. D. 350—400)‚ who uses it in its
natural sense of snaring birds.

17. crescentem, imitated by Juv. 14. 139 ‘ Crescit amor nummi
quantum ipsa pecunia crescit.’ ‘ “ Cura,’' ne perdantur3 “fames,'’
ut augeantur opes,’ Dillr. ’

18. maiorum, neut. gender μειζόνων.

19. conspicuum, prolept.=‘ ita ut conspicuum fiat.’

20. equitum decue, ‘the lesson which you preach to us, Maecenas,
by being content to be the pride of the equestrian order instead
of accepting any office which would qualify you to become a senator,'
see on 1. 20. .

23. nudus.5 To join the army of the ‘nil cupientes’ he must be,
like them, ‘nudus'; he must strip himself of the gifts of fortune
which he no longer wants‚ and be content with the cloak of which
he speaks in 3. ²9· 54. The metaphor of the camp hardly begins
till ⁴ castra.' Orelli points out that the second clause, ‘ transfuga . . .
gestio,' is an amplification of the first, and one which brings out
more clearly, though it does not create, the inexactness of the
original metaphor. To satisfy it completely, Horace must have
been a* rich man who gave up his wealth. All he really means is,
that he would choose a modest competence in preference to great
wealth.

25. contemptae, ‘which wealthier men despise.’ ‘ Satis beatus
unicis Sabinis.’ Bentley takes it as ‘ contemptae a se ipso,’ ancl so
as=‘non possessae,’ making it an oxymoron answering to ‘inter
opes inops': the poor man possessing all things though he has
nothing, the rich man a pauper in the midst of his richeS.

26, 27. For the mode of expressing the height of wealth see on
1. 1. 9 ‘si proprio condidit horreo Quidquid de Libycis verritur
areis!

26. quidquid arat, the fruits of his ploughing. Strabo (6, p. 284)
speaks of the plains of North Apulia as πάμφοροί τε καὶ πολυφόρωι,
but we hear of them chiefly as used sor pasture. For the lengthening
of the last syllable of ‘ arat ’ see on 1. 3. 36.
