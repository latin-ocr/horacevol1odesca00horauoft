THE ODES OF HORACE

et decorum est,’ ‘ non indecoro pulvere sordidos,’ &c.‚ but here he
is only speaking of the contrast between the hopes and the event.
tetigere mento, probably the Homeric πρηνέες ἐν κονίῃσιν ὀδὰξ
λαζοίατο γαῖαν, Il. 2. 418, ἃς.
13. sed me, opposed to ‘tecum,’ v. 9. The ‘sed’ contrasts the

separation of Horace’s lot from that of Pompeius in this stanza 3

with their union in the last.
Mercurius, the poet is a ⁴ Mercurialis vir,’ 2. 17. 29. Mercury

carries him safely through the foe as he led Priam through the ⁸

camp of Troy’s enemies, 1. 10. 13 foll. Horace is thinking of the
escape of Paris, Il. 3. 380, of Aeneas, 5. 344.

15. resorbens unda, the wave has thrown Horace high and
dry, its down-draught carries back Pompeius into the deep water.
See a similar image in Epp. 2. 2. 47 ‘ Civilisque rudem belli tulit
aestus m arma! -

16. fretis aestuosis seems to be one of Horace’s ablatives
absolute, see on 2. 1. 12, ‘in that boiling surf.’

ἶ

17. ergo, ‘n0w‚ then.’ 1t draws the conclusion of the whole 4·-

review, but specially refers to the reason for thankfulness just

time immersed.

obligatam, properly ‘obligari’ is said of the person, as in the
next Ode, v. 5.

18. latus, see on 3. 27. 26.

19. lauru mea. Probably with a ceitain play, ‘ my bay tree,’ the
hay being the appurtenance of poets (Od. 3. 30. 16, cp. 3. 4. 18)
as well as warriors (Od. 2. 2. 22). ‘You haven’t found the bay on
the battle-field, come and look for it in the poet's peaceful garden!

21. Horace fancies the banquet preparing, and issues orders
to the servants, ‘exple,’ ‘funde,’ ‘ quis curat?’ as in 2. 11. 18 foll.,
3. 1 . 22.

le9via, Epp. 1. 5. 23 ‘ cantharus et lanx Ostendant tibi te! The eye
as well as the palate is remembered in Horace’s feast, the graceful
shape of the cups, their shining surface, the glistening parsley.

22. ciboria, alarge cup made to imitate the pod of the Egyptian
bean (colocasium).

exple . . . capacibus, ‘let there be plenty,' Epod. 9. 33 ‘Capaci-
ores adfer huc, puer, scyphos!

24. deproperare, ‘to make with speed,' transitively‚ as ‘ prope-
rare‚' Od. 3. 24. 62, Epp. 1. 3. 28, Virg. G. 4. 171.

2 5. curatve. For the position of ‘ ve’ see on Od. 1. 30. 6. ·

Venus arbitrum dicet bibendi, see on 1. 4. 18 fregna vini
sortiere talis! ‘Venus’ was the highest throw of the four ‘tali,’
μηδενὸς ἀστραγάλου πεσόντος ἴσῳ σχήματι (Lucian), as ⁴ canis ’ (Prop-
4. 8. 45 ‘damnosi canes') was the worst‚ when all showed the
same face. The ‘tali,' originally knuckle-bones, marked only on

four sides, are different from the six-sided dice (‘tesserae‚’ κύβοι), 7

of which three were used, the highest throw being three sixes, τρὶς
ἕξ, Aesch. Agam. 33. 106
