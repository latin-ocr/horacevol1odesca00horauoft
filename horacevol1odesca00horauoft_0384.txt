THE ODES OF HORACE

political and the literary world. He had belonged to the senatorian
party, and turned Octavianus’ flank in the first day’s fighting at
Philippi. He subsequently joined Octavianus against Antony, and
commanded the centre of his fleet at Actium. After the settlement
he retired from active life, and devoted himself to oratory and
literature. He was the great friend and patron of Tibullus.

With the ‚fourth and fifth stanzas should be compared Ovid’s
imitation, A. A. 1. 237 foll. :—

‘Vina parant animos faciuntque caloribus aptos;
Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero.

Tunc veniunt risuS, tunc pauper cornua sumit;
Tunc dolor et curae rugaque frontis abit:

Tunc aperit mentis aevo rarissima nostro
Simplicitas, artis excutiente deo’;

and the fragment of Maecenas’ ‘ Symposium,’ preserved by Servius
on the words ‘facilis oculos ’ in, Virg. Aen. 8. 310: ‘ Hoc . . . etiam
Maecenas in Symposio cui Virgilius et Horatius interfuerunt, cum
ex persona Messallae de vino loqueretur, ait: idem humor ministrat

1. Ep od. 13 .6 ‘Tu vina Torquato move consule pressa meo!
The date implies that Corvinus is promised not merely old wine
(it was of the vintage of Β. c. 65, when L. Manlius Torquatus and

L. Aurelius Cotta were consuls, and therefore must have been at least ·

35 years old), but also wine which carried with it personal reminis-
cences of the poet’s own life, and which therefore it is a proof
of friendship to offer. Cp. the dating· of the Sabine wine which is
offered to Maecenas in 1. 20. .

different tempers, seems to lie in the expression of its potency,

‘it must have some great effect, whatever that be’ 3 and the stress
is really laid rather on the last of each pair of alternatives‘ seu.
sive,' ‘seu. ..’seu This is shown by the insertion of ‘pia testa’
in a place where it is intended to exert its influence on the whole
stanza, and by the repetition, after that ‘quocumque nornine’ has
again reopened the question of the tendency of the wine, of the ⁷
commendation ‘ moveri digna bona die.’

2. querelas; Epod.11. 12 ‘Querebar.. ,Simul calentis invere-
cundus deus Fervidiore mero arcana promorat loco.’ The two
pairs seem to be (1) of talk, the outpouring of passionate complaints
or of mirth; (2) of feelings, bitterness or passion on the one side, .
peaceful slumber on the other. ,

4. pia tosta, ‘gentle wine -jar.’ The epithet apologizes for the
calumnioufs supgpositions3 contrast‘ impius clamor‚’ 1. 27. 6, 6and
