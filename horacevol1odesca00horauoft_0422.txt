THE ODES OF HORACE

would avoid the awkwardness, however it be explained, of the
double designation.

18-22. quibus. ..sed The digression is intended to elevate
Drusus’ victory, by suggesting an immemorial and legendary
antiquity for his enemies. Its prosaic introduction‚ contrasting
awkwardly with the smooth finish of Horace’s style, is an in-
tentional, if not very successful, imitation of Pindar. Cp. a slighter
instance in 3. 4. 69. Many critics (Lambinus, Buttmann, Meineke,
amongst thern) have been tempted, by the fact that their excision
would cause little or no disturbance of the metre, to condemn the
lines as an interpolation, supposing the sentence to have run ‘ Vin-
delici diu’ or ‘Vindelici et diu.’ But the faults of the verses are
such as the poet is much more likely to have been guilty of than an
imitator. They formed part of the text in the time of Servius (on
Virg. Aen. 1. 243).

19. psr omne tempus, ‘through all time,’ historically.

20. Amazonia, such as the Amazons used; ‘securigerae puellae,'
Ov. Her. 4. 117. Horace would suggest apparently in this word
that there is some mythical reason for their carrying the weapon.
There need not have been any definite legend, such as Porph.
imagines, that they had fought with the Amazons, or as Servius,
that they traced their descent to them.

22. The termination of the digression in a moral saying, with
a rapid return to the straight course of the narrative, is after Pindar.
‘Sed,’ like δ’ ουν in the Greek tragedians, implies a return to the
thread of the story, ‘ however that may be.’

24. revictae, ‘conquered m their turn‚’ answering to ‘victrices.’

2 5. mens, rather of the intellect3 indoles of the temper and dis-
positions: rite, sanetis, penetralibus, are all words with religious
associations. The editors are divided on the question whether the
sentence should be stopped, as in the text, the construction being
‘ quid mens rite nutrita . . . quid indoles rite nutrita . . . posset' ;
or with the comma after ‘ mens,' so that the construction would be
‘ quid mens posset, quid indoles rite nutrita,’ &c., a distinction being
made between their mental gifts, which were all their own, and
their dispositions, which needed the good training of Augustus.
Sense, rhythm, and the balance of the verse are alike in favour
of the former. For ‘ posset‚' ‘nutrita,’ with two subjects, see on
1. 3. 10.

29. fortibus et bonis, the ablative with ‘creantur‚’ as with
‘ nasci‚' διε. ‘ Fortis et bonus' is almost a sormula; Epp. 1. 9. 13
‘et fortem crede bonumque.’ Ritter draws attention to the con-
junction ‘Nerones fortes‚' &c., as meaning, ‘remember they were
N eros to begin with,’ the name Nero being, according to Suetonius
(Tib. 1), a Sabine adjective signifying ‘fortis ac strenuus! N otice
also that ‘N erones’ is the climax—Augustus’ care, care fatherly‚
care spent on such a good stock. The thought is, ‘ It is true that
scions of a good stock must be good in men as well as in animals‚
but yet education improves the native gift? Bentley points out
