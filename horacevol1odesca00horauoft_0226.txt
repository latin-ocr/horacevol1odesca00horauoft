THE ODES OF HORACE

18. desiderium does not necessarily imply regret for what is lost
or impossible t‚⁰ get, see for instance, Od. 3. 1. 25 ‘ desiderantem
qui} ῗίῗὲῑιείζὶζ, ‘fulgentis Cycladas,’ Od. 3. 28. 14, of their marble ⁷

riocks. ‘Perhaps there is a notion of tempting to the eye but ,
estructive.

ODE XV

· NEREUS becalms Paris, as lie flies with Helen, to foretell to him .
his own fate and the destruction of Troy.

‘ Hac ode Bacchylidem imitatur; narn ut ille Cassandram facit
vaticinari futura belli Troiani ita hic Proteum‚’ Porph. (The last
word is a slip arising from a reminiscence of the prophecies ot γ
Proteus in Hom. Od. 4.) The same statement is repeated by -
a Scholiast on Stat. Theb. 7. 330. The fine verses which Clement ν
of Alexandria quotes, without giving the name of their author
(Strom. 5. 731 ὁ Λυρικός φησι), and which have been commonly
believed to belong to this poem (ὦ Τρῶες Ἀρηΐφιλοι, κτλ.) have
been found 1n the papyrus, the text of which was published by the
British Museum in 1897, to belong to another poem of Bacchylides ²
and to be part of a speech supposed to be delivered 1n the Trojan ξ
assembly by Menelaus. Ξ

The imagery of Horace’s Ode is really Homer s rather than that ⁷ ²
of the Greek lyrists‚ cp. Od. 1. 6.

A Scholiast calls the Ode an allegory of Antony and Cleopatra,
and that explanation of it is adopted by several editors, Landinus,
Baxter, and Sanadon. Ritter draws the parallel out in detail. j
Paris, hidden by Venus 1n Helen’ s chamber‚ is Antony taking refuge ⁷
in Cleopatra’s ship at Actium, διε. The theory cannot be pro· '
nounced probable, although it is true that elsew(here (see additional}
note to Ode 3. 3) Horace seems to have thought of Antony and
Cleopatra while telling of Troy and Helen. Mitsch. remarks ὡεῐξ
to the Scholiast very possibly the suggestion was due to the position ¹¹-
of the Ode. The key which had unlocked the last was applied to
this. Compare the relation of the next two Odes to one another.

The Ode is imitated by Statius, Achill. i. 20f011.

1. pastor, Virg. Aen. 7. 363 ‘ Phrygius pastor.’ ,

2. perfidus hospitam, ‘ his hostess,' cp. Od. 3. 3. 26 ‘famosus ἰ
hospeS. ’ The agreat sting of Paris' offence was that he ᾔσχυνε ξενίαν
τράπεζαν κλοπαῖσι γυναικός, Aesch. Ag. 401. For the relation Of the >
two adjectiv es, cp. 3. 7. 13 ‘perfida credulum.² ῑ

3. ingrato, to the winds themselv‚es as in Virg. Aen. 1. 55 ‘mii
indignantes magno cum murmure montis Circum claustra fremunt!
