THE ODES OF HORACE

23. vagae adds a touch, ‘ surely the sand that drives hither and
thither before the wind won't cost you much! It is time, however,

rather than sand, that he doubts his sparing3 ‘parce dare' as ’

6 parce cavere,' Od. 3. 8. 26. .

ne pareo malignus, ‘grudge not churlishly’; he puts it as
though avarice could be the only reason for his refusing. Notice
that the ‘nauta’ is supposed to be a ‘mercator’ (Od. 1. 1. 16)
sailing in pursuit of gain3 his time is money.

24 For the hiatus, cp. Epod. 13. 4 ‘Threicio Aquilone’; Virgil's
‘Actaeo Aracyntho? Ecl. 2. 24 &a

25. sic, i. e. ifyou do as Ι ask; see on Od. 1. 3. 1.

quodcumque minabitur, for the personification, cp. Virg. G. 1.
462‘ quid cogitet Auster!

Eurus fluetibus Hesperus. Horace had often heard the east
wind roaring up the valleys near Venusia as though it were on an
errand of vengeance across the Apennines. The form of expres-
sion is dictated by the love of verbal antithesis rather than by
a definite conception of the trader' 5 actual route and its risks, and
by the general notion of the wind sweeping, or threatening to
sweep, from one end of heaven to the other. As he 15 already east
of Italy, he would more probably be sailing to the east than, like
the ‘’mercator of 1. 31. 14, to the Spanish ports outside the
Straits.

27. plectantur,' 111 its usual sense not only of being lashed, but
οξ bearing the punishment, ‘may all his vengeance be wreake'd on
t em)

multa meroes, ‘a rich reward,’ i. e. for your humanity.

28. unde potest, I cannot reward you, but there is that which
will, the favour of Jove, who (as originally in his function of ξένιος)
presides especially over the reciprocal duties of men to one another,
and of Neptune the tutelary god of Tarentum, who will remember*
kindness shown to a citizen of his own. For ‘unde' of a person,
see on Od. Ι. 12. 17.

30, 31. ‘ Art thou careless of committing a crime that shall bring
punishment presently on thine innocent children? May-be even
in thine own person the debt of justice and a return of contumely
may be in store for thee. ’

31. te natis, to be taken together,‘ te’ being the ablative, as 111

‘nate Dea‚’ ‘Apolline natus? &c.: the opposition is to‘ te ipsum-⁹
‘ Te’ has also been taken (as by Nauck) as the subj. of‘ committere?
‘Is it nothing to thee that thou art committingss &c. ‘ Neglegis ,.
committere’ and ‘neglegis te committere' are both possible con-
structions.

33. non linquar, i. e. ‘a te. ’ If thou leavest me my prayers for;
vengeance will not be unheard.

36. ter, the sacred and complete number, cp. Soph. of Antigone
pouring the dust on Polynices’ body, χοαῖσι τρισπόνδοισι τὸν νέκυν
στέφει, Ant. 431.
