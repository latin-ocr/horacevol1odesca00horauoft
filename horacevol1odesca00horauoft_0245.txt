ODE XXIV

OF the person whose death is the subject of this Ode we know
ν nothing but what is contained in the statement of the Chronicon of
γ Eusebius (A. D. 264—340), which, opposite the year A. v. C. 730,
Β. C. 24, has (in the Latin version of Jerome)‘ Quintilius Cremo-
nensis Vergilii et Horatii familiaris moritur.’ We may notice that
the mention of Cremona makes him a neighbour of Virgil. The
Scholiasts on Hoiace call him Quintilius Varus, and add that he
was a Roman knight, identifying him with the Quintilius of A. P.
ἶ 438, see on v. 7, and with Varus ode.1. 18.
ᾗ The Ode is not merely, as Porph. describes it, ’θρῆνος in Quin-
i tilium sodalem Vergilii? Aer. characterizes it more justly‚‘ Con-
3 solaturVergllium impatienter amici sui mortem lugentem ' Horace's
feeling is for Virgil as much as for their common friend. From
,γ this point of view we must be struck by the delicacy of the‘ conso-
lation? He justifies Virgil's grief, he shares it. ‘He too will join
in the dirge3 Quintilius is gone, the peerless, the soul of modesty,
i honour, justice, and truth' All good men weep; and who has
greater right to weep than VirgiI, whose piety and trustfulness the
Ξ gods have so hardly rewarded. '³’ Only at last, when he has opened
his sriend’ s heart by his expression of sympathy, does he venture on
a hint, not perhaps os comfort, but of sels· restraint. ‘After all, no
{laments, though sweeter than OrpheuS, no prayers will reach the

ᾖ his Life, c. 18, that Horace is recalling his friend to his own
¹ philosophy for consolation: ‘Solitus erat dicere nullam .virtutem
