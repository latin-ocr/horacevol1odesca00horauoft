INTRODUCTION TO THE

more latitude must be given, which speak in terms of near anticipa-
tion of political events which can themselves be dated. Such are
1·. 35, which represents Augustus as on the point of starting for
Britain, a purpose for which we know that he set out from Rome in
ac, 27 (see Introd. to that Ode, Dion 53. 22, 25); and 1. 29, which
seems to refer to preparations more or less immediately preceding
Aelius Gallus’ expedition into Arabia Felix in B.c. 24.

ξ 4. Those who would go much beyond this in fixing with
accuracy the date of single· Odes have to lean a good deal on
Horace's references to events on the frontier and beyond it, move-
ments of the Cantabrian, the Scythian‚ the Parthian. In estimating
the value of these it is of course necessary to be sure of the nature
of the allusion. We are in danger of confusing poetry with history
when we look too closely into every mention of Dacian or Indian
and search the pages of Dion or Strabo for some detail that will
exactly suit it. Horace’s verses are full of the feeling of the great·
ness of the Roman empire, the remoteness of its frontiers, the
immense charge which Caesar has taken on himself. And the
names of distant and unknown places and tribes had a spell in
ancient times which they have lost in days of maps and geography.
Even when we come to more definite references, as those to the
quarrels of Phraates and Tiridates, or to the frequent risings of the
Cantabri, though we have here ample ground for dating generally
the period during the course of which the poems must have been
composed, and exactly‚ if we know the date of a special event
referred to, the year before which the particular poem could not
have been composed, we yet soon get to the point where the event
has become a standing illustration of the vicissitudes of fortune
or a statesman's anxietieS‚ a poetical commonplace which may
recur till it is supplanted by some fresh circumstance which strikes
the poet’s imagination.

To this it must be added that the foreign history of the time
is imperfectly known to us, and that some uncertainty hangs over
the dates of several of those events which are known.

§ 5. It may be convenient and may save some repetitions to give
shortly in this place the few facts which are known with respect to
the Cantabrians, the Dacians and Scythians, and the Parthians,
