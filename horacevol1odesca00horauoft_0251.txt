Book 1, ODE XXVII, 14—ODE xxv111, 1

·- ’ᾖ implies that the person addressed is inclined to hurry on and
ne lect it.

{he Ode is taken by many editors to be a dialogue, the simplest
view in this case being to suppose that the ‘ nauta’ of v. 23 speaks
. the first twenty lines and is interrupted at v. 21 by the appeal
² of a dead body for his good offices. Others, perhaps better, take it
’ as a monologue, put into the mouth of the corpse on the shore,
which first (1-20) by the address to Archytas, near whose tomb it is
lying, assures itself that it has only shared the common lot, and
ε, then by that consideration appeals to the passing sailor to give
ἱ it burial. ’“

“·’ It is one of the few Odes in which the loss of a clue which
H orace’s contemporaries probably possessed either in the knowledge
of the locality, or of some incident, or of some Greek poem (it is like

ν some of the Greek Epigrams rather than a lyric)‚ throws some real

- uncertainty over the idea of the poem. Archytas was a Pythagorean
philosopher who lived at Tarentum in the fourth century B.c.
Nothing is known of the place of his death and burial. The Ode

. seems to imply that he had a tomb on the sea-coast which Horace

3 calls (v. 3) ‘litus Matinum.' The locality of this is uncertain.

⁷4 Some have placed it near Tarentum on the ground that Archytas

ἶ belonged to that place, and that the dead man appeals to ‘Neptune

 

the guardian of Tarentum.’ The Ode might then be due to some
« ⁴ incident or association which Horace came upon in one of his
” ’ visits to Tarentum (Od. 2. 6. 9 foll.). But the arguments are stronger
i for placing it in the neighbourhood of the Prom. Garganum in Apulia,
near Horace's own country. The name occurs only in Horace (here
and in Od. 4. 2. 27 ‘ Ego apis Matinae more modoque,' and Epod.
16. 28 ‘quando Padus Matina laverit cacumina') and in Lucan Phars.
9. 185 where the ‘ buxeta Matini' are, ranked with ‘ Garganus ’ and
Mount Vultur, as belonging to Apulia. A village at the base of the
promontory of Garganus is now called ‘ Mattinata! 1t is also
noticed that the ‘woods of Venusia' (v. 26) are near enough to
stand for ‘the inland woods‚' if the scene is laid near the mouth of
⁴tlhe Aufidus, but would not occur naturally if the speaker was at

arentum.
, We may notice that Horace seems to have been interested in the
“ Pythagorean doctrines, and especially in that of Metempsychosis,

and yet not disinclined to speak playfully of them, Epod. 15. 21,

S. 2. 6. 62, Epp. 2. 1. 52. He ranks Pythagoras with Socrates and
. {lato as representing the great teachers of Greek philosophy,

. 2. 4. 3.
Metre-A lcmam‘um.

1—3. The point of the lines is ‘One who seemed in powers so
unlimited, who measured all space and counted all number, has
now in his turn such narrow limits set to him? Archytas, like

. most of the Pythagorean philosophers, was a distinguished mathe-
matician. Horace takes the two sides of mathematics‚ geometry
