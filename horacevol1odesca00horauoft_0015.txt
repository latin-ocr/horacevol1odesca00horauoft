GENERAL INTRODUCTION

Ninth century.

ξ 3. T lte oldest Bernese MS. (B) (363 in the Public Library) was

first used by Orelli in forming his text, and has since been re-collated

by Ritter for his edition, and by Usener for Keller and Holder. It
has lately been reproduced by photography and is open to examina-

tion by ali readers. 1t is assigned by Ritter and by Usener to the
ninth century ¹. It forms part of a quarto volume, which contains
also Servius' Commentary on Virgil, two Treatises on Rhetoric,
Bede's History, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses. It is imperfect,
omitting all the Epistles and the Satires (with the exception of the
first two and part of the third of Book 1) besides large portions of
the OdeS. The Odes are not arranged in their usual order, the
copyist having apparently started with the intention of an arrange-
ment according to metres, for he begins with nineteen Sapphic
Odes. These follow the common order, though the distinction of
Books is not marked. They are succeeded by some of the Epodes,
then by the Carm. Saec., then by the remaining Odes and Epodes,
also in their usual order. The Ars Poet. 1-440 follows the
Epodes, then Sat. 1. 1, 2 and part of 3. The omissions in the Odes
and Epodes are as follows :-of whole Odes in Book I, Odes 3-7‚

ἶ 9, 11, 33 and 34; in Book III, Ode 33 and of Book IV, Odes 3 and

15, besides parts of twenty-one more Odesand Epodes, viz. Odes
1. 10. 14, 1.15. 20-32, 1. 16. 15-28, 1. 17. 15, 16, 1. 19. 11—13 and
15, 1. ²9- 7—16, 2. 7. 19-28, 2. 17. 7-9, 3. 2. 2, 5-12, 17—32, 3. 4.

¹ An interesting account of the history of this and of several other of the
older MSS. of Horace is given by Ritter in the Prolegomena to his edition.
This MS. was originally in the Abbey of St. Benoit-sur-Loire, at F leury
near Orleans. When the abbey was sacked by the Protestants in the Civil
War in 1562, the MSS.‚ in which it was rich, were saved, and found
ι home in the library of Pierre Daniel, an ‘avocat’ and literary man of
Orleans‚ and ‘bailli’ of the abbey. At his death his books were divided
between two friends and fellow-townsmen, Paul Petau and Jacques Bongars.
The latter of the two died at Paris in 1612, and left his library, including
his share of the Fleury MSS.‚ to Rene de Graviset, ajeweller of Strasburg.

· De Graviset migrated subsequently t0·Switzerland‚ and his son became

a leading citizen of Bern, founded a public library there, and placed in it
his books, amongst them this MS.
