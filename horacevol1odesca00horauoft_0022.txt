GENERAL INTRODUCTION

genuine. On the other hand, as Munro pointed out 1, in' his
vigorous summary of the arguments against the interpolation
theory, the form of Horace's poems is specially his own. We are
asked to imagine that unknown poets, in the literary age of Rome,
reproduced it with a skill and completeness of which the known
poets who have tried to imitate it proved themselves incapable.
But though Peerlkamp’s method of criticism must be pronounced
baseless, we may trace from it, as from its predecessor, indirect
results of value in the attention which it calls to the sequence of
thought, the lights and shades of style, and the varying merit of the
poetry.
11. THE SCHOLIASTS.

ξ 8. The collections of Scholia on Horace which pass under the
names of Helenius Acron, and Pomponius Porphyrion, can neither
of them be certainly dated, and some doubt therefore hangs over
their relation to one another; neither of them is in a perfect state
nor free from suspicion of interpolations. Notwithstanding these
drawbackS‚ they must be considered of very high value. On
questions of text the authority of the commentary is at the least
several centuries older than any MS. of the poet, either extant or
known to us by testimony. Οἱ course the ‘lemmata,’ or quoted
words to which the comment is affixed, are of inferior importance,
and they differ not unfrequently from the text interpreted in the
commentary, and can only by themselves carry us back to the date
of the oldest MSS. of the Scholia, viz. at the earliest to centuries
9—10. On questions of interpretation, and especially of allusions
to customs, sites, and persons, the Scholia have value, inde-
pendently of any doubt as to their writer’s precise date or personal
acquaintance with Roman life, from the fact that they bear evidence
of having been composed by men who had in their hands early
authorities which are otherwise lost to us. These are sometimes
referred to by name, as Terentius Scaurus (a grammarian of
Hadrian’s time who wrote a commentary on the Ars Poetica) on
Sat. 2. 5. 92 ; Claranus (Martial‚ 10. 21. 2, Seneca, Ep. 66) on Sat.
2. 3. 83; more often generally as ‘nonnulli‚’ ‘alii,’ ‘plerique,’
‘commentator’ (Aer. on A. P. 120), ‘qui de personis Horatianis
scripserunt' (Porph. on Sat. 1. 3. 21 and 91, 2. 5. 92).
