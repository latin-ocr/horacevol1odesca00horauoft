THE ODES OF HORACE

tion. Given to the world in Virgil's lifetime‚ it is playsul and
affectionate‚ but it would seem cold and irrelevant to be published
after his early death, and in a volume in which it was the sole
record of their friendship. Franke felt the difficulty so much that
he proposed to read‘ Quintilium' for‘ Vergilium? thinking that he
could trace a correspondence between this Ode and 1. 24, especially

in v. 11 ‘heu non ita creditum? It has even been suggested that Α
it may have been another Vergilius, as is the case no doubt with ⁷

Od. 4. 12. The simplest solution is that the reference is to another
voyage. All we know even of the voyage in Β. C. 19 is due to the
fragmentary biography which goes by the name of Donatus, and
which is not supposed to be earlier than the fifth century.

It is one of the many instances of Horace’s careful placing of his
Odes that the Ode placed next to those which express his devotion
to Maecenas and to Caesar should be one that bears the name of
the friend to whose introduction (Sat. 1. 6. 54) he owed his
acquaintance with the former, and therefore with the latter-the
author of his fortunes and his literary ideal. .

The form of the Ode may have been suggested by a poem of
Callimachus, the beginning of which is preserved :— ’

ἆ ναῦς ἃ τὸ μόνον φέγγος ἐμὸν τὸ γλυκὺ τᾶς ζοᾶς
affingas, ποτί τυ Ζᾶνος ἶκνεῦμαι λιμευοσκόπω.

Statius’ Propempticon Metio Celeri, Sylv. 3. 2, is in great part an

 

expansion of Horace’s poem. We may contrast Horace's wishes

for the voyage of an enemy, Epod. 10.

The tirade against sea· t-ravelling as one form of man’ 5 restless ”
audacity is in part playfu13 and as Prof. Sellar (Roman Poets of „
the Augustan Age, p. 120) suggests, adapted to Virgil's own

temperabment and expressed feelings: but Horace recurs to the
idea that commerce and the mingling of nations are against nature
and a source of evil, and that if the golden age could return they

would cease3 Od. 3. 24. 36—41, Epod. 16. 57—62. Cp. Virg. E. 4. 2.

1— 7. sio. ..regat ..reddas This may be taken, ‘Pay back
(may Venus so guide thee),' &c., a wish, with a parenthetical wish
for that which is necessary to 'its accomplishment. But‘ sic' in
wishes, as in protestations, seems always to involve a condition3
see Conington's note on Virg. E. 9. 30 ‘Sic tua Cyrneas fugiant
examina taxos, .Incipe’ 3 cp Od. 1. 28. 25. ‘May you suffer

shipwreck if you do not pay back,’ &c. The prayer is illogical, for >¹

if the ship did suffer shipwreck on the voyage it could not l⁷and
Virgil safely. But the ship is personified, and charged by its hopes
of happiness to perform a certain task3 and what happiness can
a ship look for but calm seas and favouring winds. Ρ
