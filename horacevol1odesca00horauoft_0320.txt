THE ODES OF HORACE

Compare also Virg. G. 2. 461 foll„ and Hor. Od. 1. 31, 2. 16.
33 4ο· Metre-Hzpponacteum. See Index of MetreS, 9.

1. ebur, used for furniture, as in Sat. 2.6. 103 ‘lectos eburnos!
The Schol„ however, are possibly right in taking the words as -
ε ‘non eburnum neque aureum lacunar! Cp. Cic. Parad.1.4
‘marmoreis tectis ebore et auro fulgentibus!

2. renidet, 2. 5. 193 cp. Lucr. 2. 27 ‘Nec domus argento fulget η
auroque renidet? ›

lacunar, the panels of a ceiling, 2. 16. 11.

3. trabes Hymettiae premunt, &c., probably slabs of white
marble from Mount Hymettus in Attica, used for the architrave‚
to rest on columns of the ‘giallo antico‚’ which was found in ’
Numidia, ‘flavis Nomadum metallis,’ Stat. Silv. 1. 5. 36. Α

5, 6. Attali . . . occupavi. This seems only to mean ⁴ nor has
some rich stranger left me a palace ' ς ‘the palace of an Attalus’
being a way of saying ‘a palace of enormous wealth,’ see on Od. 1.
1. 12 ‘Attalicis condicionibus.’ It is possible that the expression ,
carried with it also the memory that the last Attalus, in default of
natural heirs, had left his property to the Roman people. .,

7. Laconicae, Pliny N. H. 9. 60 names the coast of Laconia ,
as the chief place in Europe for the shell- fish that gave the '⁷
pugplgrgggntst ‘spin, ’.Juv 2. 54‘ vos lanam trahitiS,' or perhaps τ*
rather‘ weavess ’

honestae, ‘well born! ⁷

olientae, a Plautine word, Mil. Glor.3.1. 193,&c. The two ·:
verses seem to couple two proofs of wealth, the‘ maior turba ε
clientium' of 3.1. 13 with the‘ purpurarum usus’ of ib. 42. ¹
Kiessling recalls the way in which Verres (Cic. Verr 2. 4. 26. 59) ς»
made the wealthy ladies m Sicily perform this office sor him: N ulla
domus m Sicilia locuples fuit ubi iste non textrinum instituerit,’ διο. Ῑ

9. fides, ‘.honesty'

10. benigna vena, A. P. 409 ‘divite vena' ·the metaphor is
from mining.

11. me petit, ‘seeks my sriendship. ’

14. unioie Sabinisst my single Sabine farm’; Haupt (Opusc. 3.
578), referring to Lachmann as having explained it to him, points
out that the Latin usage, in speaking of an estate when the subst. ¹
‘fundus' or ‘praedium’ is omitted, is to use the name of the Ι
people in the plural. He quotes Od. 3. 4. 21 ‘in arduos tollor} κ
Sabinos.’ See also Mayor’s note on Pliny, Epp. 3. 4 ‘cum in*
Tuscos excucurrissem.' With the‘ satis beatus’ cp. Epod. 1. 31- a.
‘Satis superque me benignitas tua Ditavit! A Sabine farm did
not rank very high in value,cp. Catull.44. 1 ‘ Ο funde noster seu
Sabine, seu Tiburs, Nam te esse Tiburtem autumant, quibus non
est Cordi Catullum laedere: at quibus cordi est, Quovis Sabinum
pignore esse contendunt?
