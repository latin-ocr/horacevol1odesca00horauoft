CARMEN SAECULARE‚ 26-46

26. seme13 see on Od. 4. 3. 1.

27. peractis3 Od. 4. 14. 39.

29. fertilis frugum; supra v. 19.

tellus. According to the inscription the sacrifice of the third
night was to Terra mater (Zosimus, Δήμητρι).

30. In reference to the ceremonies of the Ambarvalia, the festival
when the sickle was to be put to the corn3 see the description in

Tibull. 2. 1, and cp. v. 3 ‘Spicis tempora cinge, Ceres.’ The ’

Fratres Arvales wore as a badge of office a chaplet of wheat—ears ς-
‘ Spicea corona,’ Plin. N. H. 18. 2.

32. Iovis, the god of the air; Od. 1. Ι. 25, &c.

33. condito te103 Od. 2. 10. 19 ‘neque semper arcum Tendit
Apollo? His arrows carried pestilence (Hom. ΙΙ. 1. 5ο foll.)‚ so
that it is a condition of the fulfilment of the prayer of the last
stanza. Macleane remarks that the statues of Apollo Actiacus,
which Augustus had dedicated in his new temple on the galatine,
represented him in a bard's dress and with a lyre, althoug on the
promontory of Actium he stood with a drawn bow. Cp. Virg. Aen.
3. 274, 8. 704 with Propert. 3. 23. 5, 6 and 15. 16.

35. bicornis recalls her form as she is represented on medals,·
&c., with the crescent on her forehead.

37 foll. In the first clause the idea is put simply, ‘Rome is your
handiwork '; in the following clauses the same idea is suggested by

the emphatic words ⁴ Iliae' (Rome is a colony of Troy, and Apollo ·

and Artemis were guardians of Troy), ‘iussa,’ ‘ sospite' (under
divine safeguard), ‘castus’ (and so under the protection of the
goddess of chastity). Compare with the whole Od. 3. 3. 18 foll.
with the additional note at the end of it. There is the same

 

‘contrast between the‘ remnant’ preserved and the guilty city —

destroyed: ‘Castus. .patriae superstes& the rest were ‘incesti’
(see 3. 3. 19 and 23): there 1s the same emphasis on the fact that
they were bidden as a condition of protection ‘mutare Lares?
That there is a moral meaning here at least, is clear from the
petition in which this appeal ends, ‘Di probos mores‚’ &c., the
character of Aeneas, not of Paris, and therefore the old age of
Aeneas, not of Priam.

38. litus Etruscum; Od. 1. 2. 14, Epod. 16. 40. ·

39. iussa. By Apollo himself, Virg. Aen. 4. 345 ‘Sed nunc
Italiam magnam Gryneus Apollo, Italiam Lyciae iussere capessere
sortis!

41. sinefraude; Od.2. 19. 20.

4t4. {³1¹}ss relictis, ‘more than all they left behind, Rome
ins ea ο ro

45, 46. docili, placidae. Both are predicative, but some variety
is obtained by their different relation to the accusative. The
‘docility' is a condition of, or at least a prior gift to, the gift of
‘honest lives’ (cp. the address of Od. 3. 1. 4 ‘virginibus puerisque‚’
the unspoilt‚ who will listen); the‘ calm’ of temper follows the gift
of external quiet. ’
