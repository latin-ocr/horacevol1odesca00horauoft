Virg. G. 1. 233- 236‘ una corusco Semper sole rubens et torrida

Caeruleae, glacie concretae atque imbribus atris!

57. bellicosis, ‘they will seek empire by arms3 the destiny
which I have announced is theirs on this condition!

58. ‚Pii- Wfidentee two motives may induce them to forget her
warning· filial feeling towards their μητρόπολις, overweening con-
fidence in their own powers.

61. alite lugubri ε- ‘malis auspiciis' ; 1. 15. 5 ‘mala avi,' 4. 6.
23 ‘ potiore alite.'

62. iterabitur, ‘the fortunes of Troy, if in an evil hour it is

to make it more clear that any new life of the city would be but the
old life repeated, and would end' in the same catastrophe, in point

the one which ι5 reopened.

63. victrices, victorious before and to be victorious again.

‘ with the advice of Phoebus,' but it doubtless refers to the legend
that Apollo himself built the walls of Troy; Bentley compares Propert.

slaver .

69. ›eonvenietq the future suits the following ‘ Quo, Musa, tendis ?’
Horace would suggest that there is something left unsaid. With
the end of the Ode cp. that of 2. 1.
