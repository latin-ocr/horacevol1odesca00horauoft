THE ODES OF HORACE

13. vidimus, not necessarily of personal sight, ‘our generation v
has seen’; Virg. G. Ι. 471 ‘quotiens Cyclopum effervere in agros ·

Vidimus undantem ruptis fornacibus Aetnam.'

flavum, Od. 1. 8. 8, 2. 3. 18—an habitual epithet‚ otherwise we
might take it as meaning ‘ yellower than usual from the flood.'

retortis litore. Etrusco. Some doubt hangs over the meaning
of these words. It is tempting to take them of what must have
been the usual process of the Tiber's frequent flooding, the full
stream striking against the higher ‘(Etruscan) bank‚’ where the
river makes a great bend at the base of the Janiculan hill, and
being ‘ flung back' on the opposite or ‘ left bank, ’ where the valley
between the Capitoline and Palatine hills opens upon it. This
explanation is possibly right: its very simplicity however' 1s perhaps
against it. HOrace is not aiming at a naturalistic description of
causes, but adding strange and supernatural circumstances. It
should be noted that‘ litus Etruscum’ is a phrase used by him in
C. S. 38 -and Epod. 16. 40, and in the sense of ‘the shore of the
Tuscan sea.' Dion in describing the portents which followed
the death of Caesar, mentions a tidal wave which caused a flood at
the mouth of the Po, and also one which left numbers of dead fish
ashore at the mouth of the Tiber. Horace would then be com-
bining a reference to this with his description of the flooding of the
river in Rome. It is pertinent also to notice that such an arrest ot
the waters at the mouth, was a current explanation of the flooding
of rivers, see Herod. 2. 20. It would mean in this case ‘its waters
flung back at the Tuscan shore.' If the simpler sense is given,
notice that Virgil uses ‘ litus’ of a river-bank, Aen. 3. 390, 8. 83.

15. monumenta, regis would properly include both the ‘Atrium
Regium' (Liv. 26. 27), or ‘Regia‚’ the residence of the Pontifex
Maximus (and therefore of Julius Caesar), and the temple of Vesta,
which was attached to it : for both were attributed to King Numa.
Note that the identification of the cause of the flood with the
murder of Caesar begins in these words, see on v. 27.

16. templa. Virgil uses the plural in the same way, Aen. 3. 84.
The temple of Vesta, to which antiquaries had assigned several
sites, has been satisfactorily identified in the circular building‚ of
which the foundations remain, between the Palatine hill and the
‘Sacra via² (see Sat. 1. 9. 35) near the south- west corner of the
Forum Magnum.

17. nimium, with‘ querentiss c‘omplaining more than he could
bear': she complains of the murder of her great descendant.
Horace connects the name of Ilia (Rea Sylvia) with the Julian line
as Virgil does those of Ilus and Iulus, Aen. 1. 268—288. The Schol.
refer to Ennius for the story of her being thrown into the Tiber.
Claudian calls her ‘ Tiberini uxor.’ Ovid represents her as finding
a refuge and a husband in the Anio.

19. Iove non probante. Jupiter, as the Schol. says, ‘terreri
voluit populum, non perire’; he disapproves the excessive vengeance
of Ilia. For the division of a word between the third and fourth
